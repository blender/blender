KX_GameObject(SCA_IObject)
==========================

base class --- :class:`SCA_IObject`

.. class:: KX_GameObject(SCA_IObject)

   All game objects are derived from this class.

   Properties assigned to game objects are accessible as attributes of this class.

   .. note::

      Calling ANY method or attribute on an object that has been removed from a scene will raise a SystemError,
      if an object may have been removed since last accessing it use the :data:`invalid` attribute to check.

   KX_GameObject can be subclassed to extend functionality. For example:

   .. code-block:: python

        import bge

        class CustomGameObject(bge.types.KX_GameObject):
            RATE = 0.05

            def __init__(self, old_owner):
                # "old_owner" can just be ignored. At this point, "self" is
                # already the object in the scene, and "old_owner" has been
                # destroyed.

                # New attributes can be defined - but we could also use a game
                # property, like "self['rate']".
                self.rate = CustomGameObject.RATE

            def update(self):
                self.worldPosition.z += self.rate

                # switch direction
                if self.worldPosition.z > 1.0:
                    self.rate = -CustomGameObject.RATE
                elif self.worldPosition.z < 0.0:
                    self.rate = CustomGameObject.RATE

        # Called first
        def mutate(cont):
            old_object = cont.owner
            mutated_object = CustomGameObject(cont.owner)

            # After calling the constructor above, references to the old object
            # should not be used.
            assert(old_object is not mutated_object)
            assert(old_object.invalid)
            assert(mutated_object is cont.owner)

        # Called later - note we are now working with the mutated object.
        def update(cont):
            cont.owner.update()

   When subclassing objects other than empties and meshes, the specific type
   should be used - e.g. inherit from :class:`BL_ArmatureObject` when the object
   to mutate is an armature.

      colliding object only the first collision point is reported.

      .. code-block:: python

        # Function form
        def callback_three(object, point, normal):

            def on_collision_one(self, object):
                print('Hit by %r' % object.name)

      .. note::
        For backward compatibility, a callback with variable number of
        arguments (using `*args`) will be passed only the `object`
        argument. Only when there is more than one fixed argument (not
        counting `self` for methods) will the three-argument form be

      :return: (distance, globalVector(3), localVector(3))
      :rtype: 3-tuple (float, 3-tuple (x, y, z), 3-tuple (x, y, z))

   .. method:: rayCastTo(other, dist, prop)

      Look towards another point/object and find first object hit within dist that matches prop.

      The ray is always casted from the center of the object, ignoring the object itself.
      The ray is casted towards the center of another object or an explicit [x, y, z] point.
      Use rayCast() if you need to retrieve the hit point

      :arg other: [x, y, z] or object towards which the ray is casted
      :type other: :class:`KX_GameObject` or 3-tuple
      :arg dist: max distance to look (can be negative => look behind); 0 or omitted => detect up to other
      :type dist: float
      :arg prop: property name that object must have; can be omitted => detect any object
      :type prop: string
      :return: the first object hit or None if no object or object does not match prop
      :rtype: :class:`KX_GameObject`

   .. method:: rayCast(objto, objfrom, dist, prop, face, xray, poly, mask)

      Look from a point/object to another point/object and find first object hit within dist that matches prop.
      if poly is 0, returns a 3-tuple with object reference, hit point and hit normal or (None, None, None) if no hit.
      if poly is 1, returns a 4-tuple with in addition a :class:`KX_PolyProxy` as 4th element.
      if poly is 2, returns a 5-tuple with in addition a 2D vector with the UV mapping of the hit point as 5th element.

      .. code-block:: python

         # shoot along the axis gun-gunAim (gunAim should be collision-free)
         obj, point, normal = gun.rayCast(gunAim, None, 50)
         if obj:
            # do something
            pass

      The face parameter determines the orientation of the normal.

      * 0 => hit normal is always oriented towards the ray origin (as if you casted the ray from outside)
      * 1 => hit normal is the real face normal (only for mesh object, otherwise face has no effect)

      The ray has X-Ray capability if xray parameter is 1, otherwise the first object hit (other than self object) stops the ray.
      The prop and xray parameters interact as follow.

      * prop off, xray off: return closest hit or no hit if there is no object on the full extend of the ray.
      * prop off, xray on : idem.
      * prop on, xray off: return closest hit if it matches prop, no hit otherwise.
      * prop on, xray on : return closest hit matching prop or no hit if there is no object matching prop on the full extend of the ray.

      The :class:`KX_PolyProxy` 4th element of the return tuple when poly=1 allows to retrieve information on the polygon hit by the ray.
      If there is no hit or the hit object is not a static mesh, None is returned as 4th element.

      The ray ignores collision-free objects and faces that dont have the collision flag enabled, you can however use ghost objects.

      :arg objto: [x, y, z] or object to which the ray is casted
      :type objto: :class:`KX_GameObject` or 3-tuple
      :arg objfrom: [x, y, z] or object from which the ray is casted; None or omitted => use self object center
      :type objfrom: :class:`KX_GameObject` or 3-tuple or None
      :arg dist: max distance to look (can be negative => look behind); 0 or omitted => detect up to to
      :type dist: float
      :arg prop: property name that object must have; can be omitted or "" => detect any object
      :type prop: string
      :arg face: normal option: 1=>return face normal; 0 or omitted => normal is oriented towards origin
      :type face: integer
      :arg xray: X-ray option: 1=>skip objects that don't match prop; 0 or omitted => stop on first object
      :type xray: integer
      :arg poly: polygon option: 0, 1 or 2 to return a 3-, 4- or 5-tuple with information on the face hit.

         * 0 or omitted: return value is a 3-tuple (object, hitpoint, hitnormal) or (None, None, None) if no hit
         * 1: return value is a 4-tuple and the 4th element is a :class:`KX_PolyProxy` or None if no hit or the object doesn't use a mesh collision shape.
         * 2: return value is a 5-tuple and the 5th element is a 2-tuple (u, v) with the UV mapping of the hit point or None if no hit, or the object doesn't use a mesh collision shape, or doesn't have a UV mapping.

      :type poly: integer
      :arg mask: collision mask: The collision mask (16 layers mapped to a 16-bit integer) is combined with each object's collision group, to hit only a subset of the objects in the scene. Only those objects for which ``collisionGroup & mask`` is true can be hit.
      :type mask: bitfield
      :return: (object, hitpoint, hitnormal) or (object, hitpoint, hitnormal, polygon) or (object, hitpoint, hitnormal, polygon, hituv).

         * object, hitpoint and hitnormal are None if no hit.
         * polygon is valid only if the object is valid and is a static object, a dynamic object using mesh collision shape or a soft body object, otherwise it is None
         * hituv is valid only if polygon is valid and the object has a UV mapping, otherwise it is None

      :rtype:

         * 3-tuple (:class:`KX_GameObject`, 3-tuple (x, y, z), 3-tuple (nx, ny, nz))
         * or 4-tuple (:class:`KX_GameObject`, 3-tuple (x, y, z), 3-tuple (nx, ny, nz), :class:`KX_PolyProxy`)
         * or 5-tuple (:class:`KX_GameObject`, 3-tuple (x, y, z), 3-tuple (nx, ny, nz), :class:`KX_PolyProxy`, 2-tuple (u, v))

      .. note::

         If this object has instances the other instances will be updated too.

      .. note::

         The gameObject argument has an advantage that it can convert from a mesh with modifiers applied (such as the Subdivision Surface modifier).

      .. warning::

         Only triangle mesh type objects are supported currently (not convex hull)

      .. warning::

         If the object is a part of a compound object it will fail (parent or child)
