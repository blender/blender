----------------1. General notes

- The API is built with Blender in mind, with some buttons acting on lists of Blender data.
  It was not meant to be available as a separate SDK, nor to be used for other applications.
  
- It works with only OpenGL calls, for the full 100%. This means that it has some quirks
  built-in to work with all OS's and OpenGL versions. Especially frontbuffer drawing is 
  a continuous point of attention. Buttons can be drawn with any window matrix. However,
  errors can still occor when buttons are created in windows with non-standard glViewports.
  
- The code was written to replace the old 1.8 button system, but under high pressure. Quite
  some button methods from the old system were copied for that reason.
  
- I tried to design a unified GUI system, which equally works for pulldown menus, pop up menus,
  and normal button layouts. Although it gives nice features and freedom in design, the code 
  looks quite hard to understand for that reason. Not all 'normal' pulldown menu features 
  could be hacked in easily, they just differ too much from other UI elements. Could be 
  looked at once...
  
- During the past period of NaN (beginning of 2002) someone tried to make a more 'high' level
  API for it, with less low level defines and structure info needed in calling code. I am not 
  really sure if this was done well... or even finished. In the bottom of interface.c you can
  see the 'new' API which is now used in Blender code. It used to be so much more simple!
  Nevertheless, I will use that convention in this doc.

- Unfinished stuff: the code was scheduled to be expanded with 'floating blocks' which can
  serve as permanent little button-fields in Blender windows. Think for example of having
  an (optional) extra field in the 3d window displaying object loc/rot/size.
  After that, the existing button windows can be reorganized in such blocks as well, allowing
  a user to configure the genereal buttons layout (make vertical for example).
  

--------------1.1 C and H files

blender/source/blender/src/interface.c	/* almost all code */
blender/source/blender/include/interface.h 	/* internals for previous code */
blender/source/blender/include/BIF_interface.h 	/* externals for previous code */

(the previous 2 include files have not been separated fully yet)

Color and icons stuff has been put in: (unfinished code, under development)
blender/source/blender/src/resources.c 
blender/source/blender/include/BIF_resources.h

Related code:
blender/source/blender/src/toolbox.c (extra GUI elements built on top of this API)


--------------2. Windows & Blocks 

All GUI elements are collected in uiBlocks, which in turn are linked together in a list that's 
part of a Blender Area-window.

	uiBlock *block= uiNewBlock(&curarea->uiblocks, "stuff", UI_EMBOSSX, UI_HELV, curarea->win);

The next code example makes a new block, and puts it in the list of blocks of the current active 
Area:

	uiDoBlocks(&curarea->uiblocks, event);

This code is usually available in each area-window event queue handler. You give uiDoBlocks
an event code, and the uiDoBlocks handles whatever is to be handled. Blocks can be 
standard buttons or pull down menus. Can return immediately, or jump to an internal handling 
loop.

2.1 Memory allocation

Important to know is that for this toolkit there's no difference in "creating blocks" or 
"drawing blocks". In fact, for each window redraw all blocks are created again. Constructing 
button interfaces in Blender always happens in the main drawing function itself.

Memory allocation is handled as follows:
- if in this window a uiBlock with the same name existed, it is freed
- when you close a window (or blender) the uiBlocks get freed.
- when you duplicate (split) a window, the uiBlocks get copied

2.2 And how it works internally

With a call to uiDoblocks, all blocks in the current active window are evaluated.
It walks through the lists in a rather complex manner:

- while(looping)

	/* the normal buttons handling */
	- for each block
		- call uiDoBlock (handles buttons for single block)
	- (end for)
	
	/* at this moment, a new block can be created, for a menu */
	/* so we create a 2nd loop for it */
	- while first block is a menu
		- if block is a menu and not initialized: 
			- initalize 'saveunder'
			- draw it 
		- get event from queue
		- call uiDoBlock (handles buttons for single block)
		/* here, a new block again can be created, for a sub menu */
		- if return "end" from uiDoBlock
			restore 'saveunder's
			free all menu blocks
			exit from loop
		- do tooltip if nothing has happened
	- (end while)
	
	- if there was menu, it does this loop once more
	  (when you click outside a menu, at another button)
	
- (end while)

- do tooltip if nothing has happened



-------------3. API for uiBlock 

Create a new buttons block, and link it to the window:

uiBlock *uiNewBlock(ListBase *lb, char *name, short dt, short font, short win)
	ListBase *lb	pointer to list basis, where the block will be appended to (blenlib)
	char *name		unique name to identify the block. When the name exists in the list,
					the old uiBlock gets freed.
	short dt		drawtype. See below
	short font		font id number
	short win		blender area-window id

drawtype:
	UI_EMBOSSX		0	/* Rounded embossed button (standard in Blender) */
	UI_EMBOSSW		1	/* Simpler embossed button */
	UI_EMBOSSN		2	/* Button with no border */
	UI_EMBOSSF		3	/* Square embossed button (file select) */
	UI_EMBOSSM		4	/* Colored, for pulldown menus */
	UI_EMBOSSP		5	/* Simple borderless colored button (like blender sensors) */

font:
	UI_HELV			0	/* normal font */
	UI_HELVB		1	/* bold font */
With the new truetype option in Blender, this is used for all font families

When a uiBlock is created, each uiButton that is defined gets the uiBlock properties.
Changing Block properties inbetween will affact uiButtons defined thereafter.



----------3.1 uiBlock Controlling functions:

void uiDrawBlock(block)	
	draws the block

void uiBlockSetCol(uiBlock *block, int col)	

col:
	BUTGREY,
	BUTGREEN,
	BUTBLUE,
	BUTSALMON,
	MIDGREY,
	BUTPURPLE,

void uiBlockSetEmboss(uiBlock *block, int emboss)
	changes drawtype

void uiBlockSetDirection(uiBlock *block, int direction)	
	for pop-up and pulldown menus:

direction:
	UI_TOP	
	UI_DOWN	
	UI_LEFT	
	UI_RIGHT

void uiBlockSetXOfs(uiBlock *block, int xofs)
	for menus, offset from parent

void uiBlockSetButmFunc(uiBlock *block, void (*menufunc)(void *arg, int event), void *arg)
	sets function to be handled when a menu-block is marked "OK"
	
void uiAutoBlock(uiBlock *block, float minx, float miny, float sizex, float sizey, UI_BLOCK_ROWS)

	Sets the buttons in this block to automatically align, and fit within boundaries. 
	Internally it allows multiple collums or rows as well. Only 'row order' has been implemented.
	The uiDefBut definitions don't need coordinates as input here, but instead:
	- first value (x1) to indicate row number
	- width and height values (if filled in) will be used to define a relative width/height.
	A call to uiDrawBlock will invoke the calculus to fit in all buttons.



---------- 3.2 Internal function to know:

These flags used to be accessible from outside of interface.c. Currently it is only
used elsewhere by toolbox.c, so it can be considered 'internal' somewhat.

void uiBlockSetFlag(uiBlock *block, int flag)	/* block types, can be 'OR'ed */
	UI_BLOCK_LOOP		1		a sublooping block, drawn in frontbuffer, i.e. menus
	UI_BLOCK_REDRAW		2		block needs a redraw
	UI_BLOCK_RET_1		4		block is closed when an event happens with value '1' (press key, not for mouse)
	UI_BLOCK_BUSY		8		internal
	UI_BLOCK_NUMSELECT	16		keys 1-2-...-9-0 can be used to select items
	UI_BLOCK_ENTER_OK	32		enter key closes block with "OK"
	
(these values are being set within the interface.c and toolbox.c code.)


-------------4. API for uiButton 

In Blender a button can do four things:

- directly visualize data, and write to it.
- put event codes (shorts) back in the queue, to be handled
- call a user-defined function pointer (while being pressed, etc)
- create and call another block (i.e. menu)

Internally, each button or menu item is a 'uiButton', with a generic API and handling:
ui_def_but(block, type, retval, str, x1, y1, x2, y2, poin, min, max, a1, a2, tip);

Beacause a lot of obscure generic (re-use) happens here, translation calls have been made 
for each most button types individually.


-----------4.1 UiDefBut

uiBut *UiDefBut[CSIF](	uiBlock *block, int type, int retval, char *str, 
				short x1, short y1, short x2, short y2, xxxx *poin, 
				float min, float max, float a1, float a2,  char *tip)

UiDefButC	operatates on char
UiDefButS	operatates on short
UiDefButI	operatates on int
UiDefButF	operatates on float

*block:		current uiBlock pointer
type:		see below
retval:		return value, which is put back in queue
*str:		button name
x1, y1:		coordinates of left-lower corner
x2, y2:		width, height
*poin:		pointer to char, short, int, float
min, max	used for slider buttons
a1, a2		extra info for some buttons
*tip:		tooltip string

type:

1. BUT
	Activation button. (like "Render")
	Passing on a pointer is not needed
	
2. TOG or TOGN or TOGR
	Toggle button (like "Lock")
	The pointer value is set either at 0 or 1
	If pressed, it calls the optional function with arguments provided.
	Type TOGN: works negative, when pressed it sets at 0
	Type TOGR: is part of a row, redraws automatically all buttons with same *poin

	"|BIT|<nr>"
	When added to type, it works on a single bit <nr> (lowest order bit: nr = '0')

3. TOG3|BIT|<nr>
	A toggle with 3 values!
	Can be only used for short *poin.
	In the third toggle setting, the bit <nr> of *( poin+1) is set.
	
4. ROW
	Button that's part of a row. 
	in "min" you set a row-id number, in "max" the value you want *poin to be
	assigned when you press the button. Always pass on these values as floats.
	When this button is pressed, it sets the "max" value to *poin, and redraws
	all buttons with the same row-id number.

5. SLI or NUMSLI or HSVSLI
	Slider, number-slider or hsv-slider button.
	"min" and "max" are to clamp the value to.
	If you want a button type "Col" to be updated, make 'a1' equal to 'retval'
	from the COL button.
	
6. NUM
	Number button
	Set the clamping values 'min' and 'max' always as float.
	For UiDefButF, set a 'step' in 'a1', in 1/100's. The step value is the increment or
	decrement when you click once on the right or left side of a button.
	The optional button function is additionally called for each change of the *poin value.
	
7. TEX
	Text string button.
	Pointertype is standard a char. Value 'max' is length of string (pass as float).
	When button is left with ESC, it doesn't put the 'retval' at the queue.
	
8. LABEL
	Label button.
	Only displays text. 
	If 'min' is set at 1.0, the text is printed in white.
	
9  SEPR
	A separator line, typically used within pulldown menus.
	
10. MENU
	Menu button.
	The syntax of the string in *name defines the menu items:
		- %t means the previous text becomes the title
		- item separator is '|'
		- return values are indicated with %x[nr] (i.e: %x12). 
			without returnvalues, the first item gets value 0 (incl. title!)
	Example: "Do something %t| turn left %2| turn right %1| nothing %0"
	
11.	COL
	A special button that only visualizes a RGB value
	In 'retval' you can put a code, which is used to identify for sliders if it needs
	redraws while using the sliders. Check button '5'.
	As *poin you input the pointer to the 'r' value, 'g' and 'b' are supposed to be
	next to that. 


------------4.2 Icon buttons

Instead of a 'name', all buttons as described for uiDefBut also can have an icon:

uiBut *uiDefIconBut(uiBlock *block, int type, int retval, int icon, 
			short x1, short y1, short x2, short y2, void *poin, 
			float min, float max, float a1, float a2,  char *tip)

	Same syntax and types available as previous uiDefBut, but now with an icon code 
	instead of a name. THe icons are numbered in resources.c

uiBut *uiDefIconTextButF(uiBlock *block, int type, int retval, int icon, char *str, 
			short x1, short y1, short x2, short y2, float *poin, 
			float min, float max, float a1, float a2,  char *tip)

	Same again, but now with an icon and string as button name.

Two special icon buttons are available in Blender:

12. ICONROW
	(uiDefIconBut)
	This button pops up a vertical menu with a row of icons to choose from.
	'max' = amount of icons. The icons are supposed to be ordered in a sequence
	It writes in *poin which item in the menu was choosen (starting with 0).

13. ICONTEXTROW
	(uiDefIconTextBut)
	Same as previous, but with the texts next to it.



-----------4.3 pulldown menus / block buttons

14. BLOCK
void uiDefBlockBut(uiBlock *block, uiBlockFuncFP func, void *arg, char *str, 
	short x1, short y1, short x2, short y2, char *tip)

	This button creates a new block when pressed. The function argument 'func' is called
	to take care of this. An example func:
	
	static uiBlock *info_file_importmenu(void *arg_unused)
	{
		uiBlock *block;
		short yco= 0, xco = 20;
	
		block= uiNewBlock(&curarea->uiblocks, "importmenu", UI_EMBOSSW, UI_HELV, G.curscreen->mainwin);
		uiBlockSetXOfs(block, -40);  // offset to parent button
	
		/* flags are defines */
		uiDefBut(block, LABEL, 0, "VRML 2.0 options", xco, yco, 125, 19, NULL, 0.0, 0.0, 0, 0, "");
		uiDefButS(block, TOG|BIT|0, 0, "SepLayers", xco, yco-=20, 75, 19, &U.vrmlflag, 0.0, 0.0, 0, 0, "");
		uiDefButS(block, TOG|BIT|1, 0, "Scale 1/100", xco, yco-=20, 75, 19, &U.vrmlflag, 0.0, 0.0, 0, 0, "");
		uiDefButS(block, TOG|BIT|2, 0, "Two Sided", xco, yco-=20, 75, 19, &U.vrmlflag, 0.0, 0.0, 0, 0, "");
	
		uiBlockSetDirection(block, UI_RIGHT);
		uiTextBoundsBlock(block, 50);	// checks for fontsize

		return block;
	}

	The uiDef coordinates here are only relative. When this function is called, the interface 
	code automatically makes sure the buttons fit in the menu nicely. 
	
	Inside a menu uiBlock, other uiBlocks can be invoked to make a hierarchical menu.



-----------4.4 specials

15. KEYEVT

void uiDefKeyevtButS(uiBlock *block, int retval, char *str, 
		short x1, short y1, short x2, short y2, short *spoin, char *tip)

	A special button, which stores a keyvalue in *spoin. When the button is pressed,
	it displays the text 'Press any Key'. A keypress then stores the value.
	
16. LINK and INLINK

	These button present a method of linking data in Blender, by drawing a line from one
	icon to another. It consists of two button types:
	
	LINK, the 'linking from' part, can be:
	- a single pointer to data (only one line allowed)
	- an array of pointers to data. The LINK buttons system  keeps track of allocating 
	  space for the array, and set the correct pointers in it.
	
	INLINK, the 'linking to' part activates creating a link, when a user releases the mouse 
	cursor over it, while dragging a line from the LINK button.
	
	These buttons are defined as follows:
	
		
uiBut but= uiDefIconBut(block, LINK, 0, ICON_LINK,	x1, y1, w, h, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0, "");
	/* create the LINK icon */

uiSetButLink(but, void **pt, void ***ppt, short *totlink, short fromcode, short tocode);
	**pt: pointer to pointer (only one link allowed)
	***ppt: pointer to pointerpointer (an array of pointers)
	(Either one of these values should be NULL)
	
	fromcode: (currently unused)
	tocode: a short indicating which blocks it can link to. 
	
	
uiDefIconBut(block, INLINK, 0, ICON_INLINK, x1, y1, w, h, void *poin, short fromcode, 0, 0, 0, "");
	poin: the pointer of the datablock you want to create links to
	fromcode: a short identifying which LINK buttons can connect to it 			  
	


17. IDPOIN
void uiDefIDPoinBut(uiBlock *block, uiIDPoinFuncFP func, int retval, char *str, 
			short x1, short y1, short x2, short y2, void *idpp, char *tip)

	The ID struct is a generic part in structs like Object, Material, Mesh, etc.
	Most linking options in Blender happens using ID's. (Mesh -> Material).
	
	This special button in Blender visualizes an ID pointer with its name. Typing in
	a new name, changes the pointer. For most ID types in Blender functions have been
	written already, needed by this button, to check validity of names, and assign the pointer.
	
	(BTW: the 'void *idpp' has to be a pointer to the ID pointer!)

	Example function that can be put in 'func':
	
	void test_scriptpoin_but(char *name, ID **idpp)
	{
		ID *id;
		
		id= G.main->text.first;
		while(id) {
			if( strcmp(name, id->name+2)==0 ) {
				*idpp= id;
				return;
			}
			id= id->next;
		}
		*idpp= 0;
	}


------------- 4.5 uiButton control fuctions


void uiButSetFunc(uiBut *but, void (*func)(void *arg1, void *arg2), void *arg1, void *arg2)
	When the button is pressed and released, it calls this function, with the 2 arguments.

void uiButSetFlag(uiBut *but, int flag)
	set a flag for further control of button behaviour:
	flag:
	UI_TEXT_LEFT
	
int uiButGetRetVal(uiBut *but)
	gives return value
