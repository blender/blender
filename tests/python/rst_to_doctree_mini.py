# Module with function to extract a doctree from an reStructuredText file.
# Named 'Mini' because we only parse the minimum data needed to check
# Python classes, methods and attributes match up to those in existing modules.
# (To test for documentation completeness)

# note: literalinclude's are not followed.
# could be nice to add but not really needed either right now.
