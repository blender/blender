Welcome to the fun world of open-source.

This file is to help you get started using the source and will hopefully
answer most questions.

Here are some links to external packages you may or maynot need:

openssl:  http://www.openssl.org
python:  http://www.python.org
mxtexttools:http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxTextTools.html (python lib)
libjpeg:  http://www.ijg.org/
libpng:  http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/
zlib:   http://www.gzip.org/zlib/
openal:  http://www.openal.org/home/		(for linux/windows)
	sdl: http://www.libsdl.org/index.php (for openal)
	smpeg: http://www.lokigames.com/development/smpeg.php3 (for openal)
fmod: http://www.fmod.org/

mozilla: http://www.mozilla.org/
nspr:  ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/nspr/releases
	(side note: on debian linux you will need mozilla-dev and libnspr-dev)

If you do not have GL you will also need mesa:

We are in the process of moving things over to automake/autoconf
The old makefiles are still in place and will work.  If you want to
get a working blender skip down to the next section and use this readme as
a guide.

If you want to play with the new autoconf environment you need to do the 
following, inside this dir:
./bootstrap
mkdir ../newdir
cd ../newdir
../blender/configure

Take a look at INSTALL for options you can give to configure.
About half of the intern directory is done so you won't get very far.
If you want to work on fixing it you need to edit Makefile.am's and 
configure.ac
after editing those files you need to run bootstrap again.

TODO to finish up the intern dir
Square away how ghost works.
(i.e. would be nice if under windows you could choose X11 or normal windows
libs, same with macos.. right now its a cludge and it doesn't do one explicitly
probably involves changing the way configure.ac picks stuff)

Get intern/python figured out.

Add the following to configure.ac
	--with-openssl=dir
	--with-mozilla=dir	(get it so nspr is autodetected here)
	--with-nspr=dir		(incase in different dir)
	--with-jpeg=dir
	--with-png=dir
	--with-zlib=dir

figure out why the heck the libtool that gets created is wrong on my
system (mein@cs.umn.edu) :)

--Notes on compiling mxTextTools----------------------------------------------
To get the latest version to compile on my machine I had to
edit mxSetup.py and remove /usr/include from INCLPATH for it to build
properly.
(after doing this you need to edit blender/source/Makefile and
fix the pointer to it I'm still working on automating this)

--------------Basic Makefile TIPS---------------------------------------
Assuming you are using tcsh/csh do the following before compiling.
#Set this to wherever you have extracted the source.
setenv NANBLENDERHOME `pwd`
setenv MAKEFLAGS "-w -I$NANBLENDERHOME/source"

Or for bash/sh do this:
NANBLENDERHOME=`pwd`
export NANBLENDERHOME
MAKEFLAGS="-w -I$NANBLENDERHOME/source"
export MAKEFLAGS

Then edit source/nan_definitions.mk to fit you're environment.
(You'll want to change things like NAN_OPENSSL,NAN_JPEG, NAN_PNG etc.. 
to point to where you have it installed)

If you tried to just have a go at making stuff you might wind up with
an empty file /tmp/.nanguess
You need to remove the empty file and it will get created automatically
by $NANBLENDERHOME/source/tools/guess/guessconfig after you have 
setup the NANBLENDERHOME variable.

After that cd $NANBLENDERHOME/intern 
make
make install

cd $NANBLENDERHOME/source/ode
Look at the README_BLENDER and follow instructions

Then cd $NANBLENDERHOME/source
make

----------------------Mac OSX TIPS--------------------------------------
Now before you go to the source directory, make sure you have installed the
external libraries that Blender depends upon. Here is a description of the 
things you need.

FINK:
Use fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net/) to install the following libraries that
Blender depends on:
1. openssl (fink install openssl)
2. jpeg    (fink install jpeg)
3. png     (fink install png)

PYTHON:
Mac OSX 10.2 (Jaguar) now comes with Python (2.2.1) pre-installed. This is fine
for producing the "frozen" Python code found in the intern directory. However,
the installation does not contain the python library to link against (at least
I could not find it). You could use fink to install Python but that Python 
installation depends on X being installed and that is a large installation.

If you prefer the easy way: download Python 2.2.2 from http://www.python.org.
Follow the instructions to in the documentation to install it on your box. If
you run OSX 10.2 it should install just fine. Basically a configure and a 
"make" will do the job. The result is a Python library that should be copied to
the library tree together with the associated header files.

Create the following  directories:
$NANBLENDERHOME/lib/darwin-6.1-powerpc/python/include/python2.2
$NANBLENDERHOME/lib/darwin-6.1-powerpc/python/lib/python2.2/config
Now copy the include files and the libpython2.2.a library to those locations.

FMOD:
Download FMOD from http://www.fmod.org/ and unpack with StuffIt Expander. The
archive contains header files and a library. Copy those to these directories
(that you need to create first):
$NANBLENDERHOME/lib/darwin-6.1-powerpc/fmod/include
$NANBLENDERHOME/lib/darwin-6.1-powerpc/fmod/lib

RANLIB:
Although the make files run ranlib on the libraries built, the gcc linker 
complains about ranlib not being run. Until there is a solution, you will need
to run ranlib by hand once in a while when the make breaks. Luckily, the error
message lists the full path of the file to run ranlib on... Anybody out there 
with a real solution? I guess the problem arises from copying the files from 
one location to the other...

Now wait, don't type make yet! You'll have to edit a config file of ODE first.
go to $NANBLENDERHOME/source/ode/config and edit the file "user-settings" so 
that platform is equal to osx (PLATFORM=osx).

Success!
