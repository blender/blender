/** \file blender/blenlib/intern/BLI_array.c
 *  \ingroup bli
 *  \brief A (mainly) macro array library.
 *
 * This is an array library, used to manage array (re)allocation.
 *
 * \note This is primarily accessed via macros,
 * functions are used to implement some of the internals.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * int *arr = NULL;
 * BLI_array_declare(arr);
 * int i;
 *
 * for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 *     BLI_array_grow_one(arr);
 *     arr[i] = something;
 * }
 * BLI_array_free(arr);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Arrays are over allocated, so each reallocation the array size is doubled.
 * In situations where contiguous array access isn't needed,
 * other solutions for allocation are available.
 * Consider using on of: BLI_memarena.c, BLI_mempool.c, BLi_stack.c
