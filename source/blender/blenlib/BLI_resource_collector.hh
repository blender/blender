 * A ResourceCollector holds an arbitrary set of resources, that will be destructed and/or freed
 * when the ResourceCollector is destructed. This is useful when some object has to take ownership
 * of other objects, but it does not know the type of those other objects.
 *
 * Resources owned by the ResourceCollector will be freed in reverse order. That allows resources
 * that are added later to depend on resources that have been added before.
