/** \file
 * \ingroup blenloader
 *
 * This file contains an API that allows different parts of Blender to define what data is stored
 * in .blend files.
 *
 * Four callbacks have to be provided to fully implement .blend I/O for a piece of data. One of
 * those is related to file writing and three for file reading. Reading requires multiple
 * callbacks, due to the way linking between files works.
 *
 * Brief description of the individual callbacks:
 *  - Blend Write: Define which structs and memory buffers are saved.
 *  - Blend Read Data: Loads structs and memory buffers from file and updates pointers them.
 *  - Blend Read Lib: Updates pointers to ID data blocks.
 *  - Blend Expand: Defines which other data blocks should be loaded (possibly from other files).
 *
 * Each of these callbacks uses a different API functions.
 *
 * Some parts of Blender, e.g. modifiers, don't require you to implement all four callbacks.
 * Instead only the first two are necessary. The other two are handled by general ID management. In
 * the future, we might want to get rid of those two callbacks entirely, but for now they are
 * necessary.

/* Blend Write API
 * ===============
 *
 * Most functions fall into one of two categories. Either they write a DNA struct or a raw memory
 * buffer to the .blend file.
 *
 * It is safe to pass NULL as data_ptr. In this case nothing will be stored.
 *
 * DNA Struct Writing
 * ------------------
 *
 * Functions dealing with DNA structs begin with BLO_write_struct_*.
 *
 * DNA struct types can be identified in different ways:
 *  - Run-time Name: The name is provided as const char *.
 *  - Compile-time Name: The name is provided at compile time. This is more efficient.
 *  - Struct ID: Every DNA struct type has an integer ID that can be queried with
 *      BLO_get_struct_id_by_name. Providing this ID can be a useful optimization when many structs
 *      of the same type are stored AND if those structs are not in a continuous array.
 *
 * Often only a single instance of a struct is written at once. However, sometimes it is necessary
 * to write arrays or linked lists. Separate functions for that are provided as well.
 *
 * There is a special macro for writing id structs: BLO_write_id_struct. Those are handled
 * differently from other structs.
 *
 * Raw Data Writing
 * ----------------
 *
 * At the core there is BLO_write_raw, which can write arbitrary memory buffers to the file. The
 * code that reads this data might have to correct its byte-order. For the common cases there are
 * convenience functions that write and read arrays of simple types such as int32. Those will
 * correct endianness automatically.

/* Blend Read Data API
 * ===================
 *
 * Generally, for every BLO_write_* call there should be a corresponding BLO_read_* call.
 *
 * Most BLO_read_* functions get a pointer to a pointer as argument. That allows the function to
 * update the pointer to its new value.
 *
 * When the given pointer points to a memory buffer that was not stored in the file, the pointer is
 * updated to be NULL. When it was pointing to NULL before, it will stay that way.
 *
 * Examples of matching calls:
 *   BLO_write_struct(writer, ClothSimSettings, clmd->sim_parms);
 *   BLO_read_data_address(reader, &clmd->sim_parms);
 *
 *   BLO_write_struct_list(writer, TimeMarker, &action->markers);
 *   BLO_read_list(reader, &action->markers);

 *   BLO_write_int32_array(writer, hmd->totindex, hmd->indexar);
