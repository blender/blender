/* RayObject
 *
 *  A ray object is everything where we can cast rays like:
 *      * a face/triangle
 *      * an octree
 *      * a bvh tree
 *      * an octree of bvh's
 *      * a bvh of bvh's
 *
 *
 *  All types of RayObjects can be created by implementing the
 *  callbacks of the RayObject.
 *
 *  Due to high computing time evolved with casting on faces
 *  there is a special type of RayObject (named RayFace)
 *  which won't use callbacks like other generic nodes.
 *
 *  In order to allow a mixture of RayFace+RayObjects,
 *  all RayObjects must be 4byte aligned, allowing us to use the
 *  2 least significant bits (with the mask 0x03) to define the
 *  type of RayObject.
 *
 *  This leads to 4 possible types of RayObject:
 *
 *   addr&3  - type of object
 *      0       Self (reserved for each structure)
 *      1       RayFace (tri/quad primitive)
 *      2       RayObject (generic with API callbacks)
 *      3       VlakPrimitive
 *              (vlak primitive - to be used when we have a vlak describing the data
 *               eg.: on render code)
 *
 *  0 means it's reserved and has it own meaning inside each ray acceleration structure
 *  (this way each structure can use the align offset to determine if a node represents a
 *   RayObject primitive, which can be used to save memory)
