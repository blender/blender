/** \file
 * \ingroup fn
 *
 * A `MultiFunction` encapsulates a function that is optimized for throughput (instead of latency).
 * The throughput is optimized by always processing many elements at once, instead of each element
 * separately. This is ideal for functions that are evaluated often (e.g. for every particle).
 *
 * By processing a lot of data at once, individual functions become easier to optimize for humans
 * and for the compiler. Furthermore, performance profiles become easier to understand and show
 * better where bottlenecks are.
 *
 * Every multi-function has a name and an ordered list of parameters. Parameters are used for input
 * and output. In fact, there are three kinds of parameters: inputs, outputs and mutable (which is
 * combination of input and output).
 *
 * To call a multi-function, one has to provide three things:
 * - `MFParams`: This references the input and output arrays that the function works with. The
 *      arrays are not owned by MFParams.
 * - `IndexMask`: An array of indices indicating which indices in the provided arrays should be
 *      touched/processed.
 * - `MFContext`: Further information for the called function.
 *
 * A new multi-function is generally implemented as follows:
 * 1. Create a new subclass of MultiFunction.
 * 2. Implement a constructor that initialized the signature of the function.
 * 3. Override the `call` function.
