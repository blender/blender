/**
 * @page execution Execution model
 * In order to get to an efficient model for execution, several steps are being done. these steps are explained below.
 *
 * @section EM_Step1 Step 1: translating blender node system to the new compsitor system
 * Blenders node structure is based on C structs (DNA). These structs are not efficient in the new architecture.
 * We want to use classes in order to simplify the system.
 * during this step the blender node_tree is evaluated and converted to a CPP node system.
 *
 * @see ExecutionSystem
 * @see Converter.convert
 * @see Node
 *
 * @section EM_Step2 Step2: translating nodes to operations
 * Ungrouping the GroupNodes. Group nodes are node_tree's in node_tree's.
 * The new system only supports a single level of node_tree. We will 'flatten' the system in a single level.
 * @see GroupNode
 * @see ExecutionSystemHelper.ungroup
 *
 * Every node has the ability to convert itself to operations. The node itself is responsible to create a correct
 * NodeOperation setup based on its internal settings.
 * Most Node only need to convert it to its NodeOperation. Like a ColorToBWNode doesn't check anything,
 * but replaces itself with a ConvertColorToBWOperation.
 * More complex nodes can use different NodeOperation based on settings; like MixNode.
 * based on the selected Mixtype a different operation will be used.
 * for more information see the page about creating new Nodes. [@subpage newnode]
 *
 * @see ExecutionSystem.convertToOperations
 * @see Node.convertToOperations
 * @see NodeOperation base class for all operations in the system
 *
 * @section EM_Step3 Step3: add additional conversions to the operation system
 *   - Data type conversions: the system has 3 data types COM_DT_VALUE, COM_DT_VECTOR, COM_DT_COLOR.
 *     The user can connect a Value socket to a color socket.
 *     As values are ordered differently than colors a conversion happens.
 *
 *   - Image size conversions: the system can automatically convert when resolutions do not match.
 *     An NodeInput has a resize mode. This can be any of the following settings.
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.COM_SC_CENTER]: The center of both images are aligned
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.COM_SC_FIT_WIDTH]: The width of both images are aligned
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.COM_SC_FIT_HEIGHT]: the height of both images are aligned
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.COM_SC_FIT]: The width, or the height of both images are aligned to make sure that it fits.
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.COM_SC_STRETCH]: The width and the height of both images are aligned
 *     - [@ref InputSocketResizeMode.COM_SC_NO_RESIZE]: bottom left of the images are aligned.
 *
 * @see Converter.convertDataType Datatype conversions
 * @see Converter.convertResolution Image size conversions
 *
 * @section EM_Step4 Step4: group operations in executions groups
 * ExecutionGroup are groups of operations that are calculated as being one bigger operation.
 * All operations will be part of an ExecutionGroup.
 * Complex nodes will be added to separate groups. Between ExecutionGroup's the data will be stored in MemoryBuffers.
 * ReadBufferOperations and WriteBufferOperations are added where needed.
