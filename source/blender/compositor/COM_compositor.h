 * @defgroup Model The data model of the compositor

 * @defgroup Node All nodes of the compositor

 *
 * @page Introduction of the Blender Compositor
 *
 * @section bcomp Blender compositor
 * This project redesigns the internals of Blender's compositor. The project has been executed in 2011 by At Mind.
 * At Mind is a technology company located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
 * The project has been crowd-funded. This code has been released under GPL2 to be used in Blender.
 *
 * @section goals The goals of the project
 * the new compositor has 2 goals.
 *   - Make a faster compositor (speed of calculation)
 *   - Make the compositor work faster for you (workflow)
 *
 * @section speed Faster compositor
 * The speedup has been done by making better use of the hardware Blenders is working on. The previous compositor only
 * used a single threaded model to calculate a node. The only exception to this is the Defocus node.
 * Only when it is possible to calculate two full nodes in parallel a second thread was used.
 * Current workstations have 8-16 threads available, and most of the time these are idle.
 *
 * In the new compositor we want to use as much of threads as possible. Even new OpenCL capable GPU-hardware can be
 * used for calculation.
 *
 * @section workflow Work faster
 * The previous compositor only showed the final image. The compositor could wait a long time before seeing the result
 * of his work. The new compositor will work in a way that it will focus on getting information back to the user.
 * It will prioritize its work to get earlier user feedback.
 *
 * @page memory Memory model
 * The main issue is the type of memory model to use. Blender is used by consumers and professionals.
 * Ranging from low-end machines to very high-end machines.
 * The system should work on high-end machines and on low-end machines.
 *
 *
 * @page executing Executing
 * @section prepare Prepare execution
 *
 * during the preparation of the execution All ReadBufferOperation will receive an offset.
 * This offset is used during execution as an optimization trick
 * Next all operations will be initialized for execution @see NodeOperation.initExecution
 * Next all ExecutionGroup's will be initialized for execution @see ExecutionGroup.initExecution
 * this all is controlled from @see ExecutionSystem.execute
 *
 * @section priority Render priority
 * Render priority is an priority of an output node. A user has a different need of Render priorities of output nodes
 * than during editing.
 * for example. the Active ViewerNode has top priority during editing, but during rendering a CompositeNode has.
 * All NodeOperation has a setting for their render-priority, but only for output NodeOperation these have effect.
 * In ExecutionSystem.execute all priorities are checked. For every priority the ExecutionGroup's are check if the
 * priority do match.
 * When match the ExecutionGroup will be executed (this happens in serial)
 *
 * @see ExecutionSystem.execute control of the Render priority
 * @see NodeOperation.getRenderPriority receive the render priority
 * @see ExecutionGroup.execute the main loop to execute a whole ExecutionGroup
 *
 * @section order Chunk order
 *
 * When a ExecutionGroup is executed, first the order of chunks are determined.
 * The settings are stored in the ViewerNode inside the ExecutionGroup. ExecutionGroups that have no viewer-node,
 * will use a default one.
 * There are several possible chunk orders
 *  - [@ref OrderOfChunks.COM_TO_CENTER_OUT]: Start calculating from a configurable point and order by nearest chunk
 *  - [@ref OrderOfChunks.COM_TO_RANDOM]: Randomize all chunks.
 *  - [@ref OrderOfChunks.COM_TO_TOP_DOWN]: Start calculation from the bottom to the top of the image
 *  - [@ref OrderOfChunks.COM_TO_RULE_OF_THIRDS]: Experimental order based on 9 hot-spots in the image
 *
 * When the chunk-order is determined, the first few chunks will be checked if they can be scheduled.
 * Chunks can have three states:
 *  - [@ref ChunkExecutionState.COM_ES_NOT_SCHEDULED]: Chunk is not yet scheduled, or dependencies are not met
 *  - [@ref ChunkExecutionState.COM_ES_SCHEDULED]: All dependencies are met, chunk is scheduled, but not finished
 *  - [@ref ChunkExecutionState.COM_ES_EXECUTED]: Chunk is finished
 *
 * @see ExecutionGroup.execute
 * @see ViewerOperation.getChunkOrder
 * @see OrderOfChunks
 *
 * @section interest Area of interest
 * An ExecutionGroup can have dependencies to other ExecutionGroup's. Data passing from one ExecutionGroup to another
 * one are stored in 'chunks'.
 * If not all input chunks are available the chunk execution will not be scheduled.

 * the WorkScheduler is implemented as a static class. the responsibility of the WorkScheduler is to balance

 *
 * @subsection multithread Multi threaded
 * Default the work-scheduler will place all work as WorkPackage in a queue.
 * For every CPUcore a working thread is created. These working threads will ask the WorkScheduler if there is work
 * for a specific Device.
 * the work-scheduler will find work for the device and the device will be asked to execute the WorkPackage
 *
 * @subsection singlethread Single threaded
 * For debugging reasons the multi-threading can be disabled. This is done by changing the COM_CURRENT_THREADING_MODEL
 * to COM_TM_NOTHREAD. When compiling the work-scheduler
 * will be changes to support no threading and run everything on the CPU.
 *
 * @section devices Devices
 * A Device within the compositor context is a Hardware component that can used to calculate chunks.
 * This chunk is encapsulated in a WorkPackage.
 * the WorkScheduler controls the devices and selects the device where a WorkPackage will be calculated.
 *
 * @subsection WS_Devices Workscheduler
 * The WorkScheduler controls all Devices. When initializing the compositor the WorkScheduler selects
 * all devices that will be used during compositor.
 * There are two types of Devices, CPUDevice and OpenCLDevice.
 * When an ExecutionGroup schedules a Chunk the schedule method of the WorkScheduler
 * The Workscheduler determines if the chunk can be run on an OpenCLDevice
 * (and that there are available OpenCLDevice). If this is the case the chunk will be added to the worklist for
 * OpenCLDevice's
 * otherwise the chunk will be added to the worklist of CPUDevices.
 *
 * A thread will read the work-list and sends a workpackage to its device.

 * When a CPUDevice gets a WorkPackage the Device will get the inputbuffer that is needed to calculate the chunk.
