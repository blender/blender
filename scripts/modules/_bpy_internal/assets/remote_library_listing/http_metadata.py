    """HTTP Metadata provider that can check an extra file.

    This is to support the following file sets:

    - `file.json`: Actual JSON file read by Blender. Is assumed to be validated.
    - `file-unsafe.json`: JSON file as downloaded. Must be validated before use.
    - `file-unsafe.json~`: The above file while it's being downloaded. Not yet
      complete JSON.

    The downloader will get the request to download to `file-unsafe.json`.
    However, if `file.json` is still fresh (i.e. the HTTP metadata for the URL
    is appliccable to that file), the downloader should be able to do a
    conditional download (instead of an unconditional one).

    This is implemented as a wrapper for any other MetadataProvider, rather than
    subclassing a specific one, so that it's independent of the underlying
    logic.
