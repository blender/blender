    Request an URL and stream the body of the response to a file on disk.
    Metadata is saved in a caller-determined location on disk.

    When the file on disk already exists, conditional downloading is performed
    via the HTTP headers 'ETag'/'If-None-Match' and 'Last-Modified'/
    'If-Modified-Since'. When the HTTP server indicates the local file is up to
    date, via a `304 Not Modified` response, the file is not downloaded again.

    This class is fully synchronous, and will thus block the caller until the
    download is complete. It should not typically be used from Blender, as it
    can block the user interface. See `BackgroundDownloader` to download things
    in a background process.
