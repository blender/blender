    Pass ApplyRadialDistortionCameraIntrinsics input arguments by reference
    
    This shall save some CPU time on calling copy constructor and give
    some boost of bundle adjuster (where jet could take some time to
    be passed by value).

    Cleanup in simple pipeline's bundler
    
    - Better match Google's code style conventions.
    - Move evaluation part into own function, makes
      bundling itself easier to follow.
    - Made evaluation an optional parameter.
    - Removed note about unsupported camera intrinsics
      refining flags. Technically, all combinations
      are possible.

    Remove check for zero focal length in BA cost functor
    
    This check is actually redundant, because empty intrinsics
    will have focal length of 1.0, which means original comment
    about BundleIntrinsics was not truth.
    
    It is possible that external user will send focal length of
    zero to be refined, but blender prevents this from happening.

    Keyframe selection improvements
    
    Added additional criteria, which ignores
    keyframe pair if success intersection factor
    is lower than current candidate pair factor.
    
    This solves issue with keyframe pair at which
    most of the tracks are intersecting behind the
    camera is accepted (because variance in this
    case is really small),
    
    Also tweaked generalized inverse function,
    which now doesn't scale epsilon by maximal
    matrix element. This gave issues at really bad
    candidates with unstable covariance. In this
    case almost all eigen values getting zeroed
    on inverse leading to small expected error.

    Keyframe selection code cleanup
    
    - Updated comments in code.
    - Removed currently unused functions.
      Actually, they'd better be moved to some generic
      logging module, but we don't have it now so was
      lazy to create one now. Could happen later using
      code from git history
    - Renamed function to match better to what's going
      on in it.

    Optimization for reconstruction variance
    
    Achieved by replacing SVD-based pseudo-inverse with
    an eigen solver pseudo inverse.
    
    New function works in the same way: it decomposes
    matrix to V*D*V^-1, then inverts diagonal of D
    and composes matrix back.
    
    The same way is used to deal with gauges - last
    7 eigen values are getting zeroed.
    
    In own tests gives approx 2x boost, without
    visible affect on selected keyframe quality.

    Initial commit of reconstruction variance criteria
    which is an addition for GRIC-based keyframe selection.
    
    Uses paper Keyframe Selection for Camera Motion and Structure
    Estimation from Multiple Views,
    ftp://ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de/pub/papers/2004/ECCV2004-TTHBAW.pdf
    as a basis.
    
    Currently implemented camera positions reconstructions,
    bundle positions estimation and bundle adjustment step.
    
    Covariance matrix is estimating using generalized inverse
    with 7 (by the number of gauge freedoms) zeroed eigen values
    of J^T * J.
    
    Additional changes:
    - Added utility function FundamentalToEssential to extract
      E from F matrix, used by both final reconstruction pipeline
      and reconstruction variance code.
    
    - Refactored bundler a bit, so now it's possible to return
      different evaluation data, such as number of cameras and
      points being minimized and also jacobian.
    
      Jacobian currently contains only camera and points columns,
      no intrinsics there yet. It is also currently converting to
      an Eigen dense matrix. A bit weak, but speed is nice for
      tests.
    
      Columns in jacobian are ordered in the following way:
      first columns are cameras (3 cols for rotation and 3 cols
      for translation), then goes 3D point columns.
    
    - Switched F and H refining to normalized space. Apparently,
      refining F in pixel space squeezes it a lot making it wrong.
    
    - EuclideanIntersect will not add point to reconstruction if
      it happened to be behind the camera.
    
    - Cleaned style a bit.

    Add check for points behind camera in euclidan BA cost functor
    
    In cases keyframes are no so good, algebraic two frames construction
    could produce result, for which more aggressive Ceres-based BA code
    will fall to a solution for which points goes behind the camera,
    which is not so nice.
    
    Seems in newer Ceres returning false from cost functor wouldn't
    abort solution, but will restrict solver from moving points behind
    the camera.
    
    Works fine in own tests, but requires more tests.

    projective one is not finished anyway.

    Fix for bundle adjusting with motion restricted
    
    Was a bug introduced in previous commit, which
    was trying to set parameterization for non-existing
    camera->t parameter block.
    
    Replaced with subset parameterization.
    
    Also added basic synthetic unit test for modal solver.

     Bundle adjustment improvements
    
    - Get rid of rotation matrix parameterization,
      use angle-axis instead.
    
      Also Joined rotation and translation into
      a single parameter block.
    
      This made minimization go significantly faster,
      like 1.3x times in average.
    
    - Fix first camera when bundling. This is to
      address orientation ambiguity.
    
      Reconstruction result could still vary in
      size, but that's another issue to be addressed
      later.
    
    Additional change:
    
    Split EuclideanBundleCommonIntrinsics into
    smaller functions, so it's now a bit easier
    to follow.

    Revert "Change libmv's bilinear sampling to assume the same"
    
    Revert changes to bilinear sampler which were originally
    aimed to match blender's pixel center (where integer coord
    is a left-bottom corner, x.5 coords are centers.
    
    The reason of revert is changing this assumption in only
    sampler didn't work well and lead to wrong results of
    BlurredImageAndDerivativesChannels for example.
    
    Discovered when was doing unit-tests for brute region tracker.

    Tweak to KLT region tracker test
    
    KLT is usually used to track relatively small
    motions, and in this case motion almost equals
    to half window size. This confuses math and
    leads to not so much expected result.
    
    Further, not actually sure this is nice idea
    to use KLT in such synthetic case.

    Pyramid tracker unit test fix
    
    Issue was caused by trackers modifying guessed
    point location even in case of failure. So made
    id so both level 0 and level 3 of pyramid are
    starting from the same initial guessed location.
    
    Modifying locations in case tracker returns false
    is not actually a bug - someone could still want
    to use that location. False in this case  means
    more like "returned location is not so much
    accurate".

    Intersect unit test fix
    
    EuclideanIntersect is not aware of camera calibration
    matrix yet and always assumes it to be an identity.
    
    So using non-identity matrix to construct sample case
    leads to wrong projection results.
    
    For now made it so test case uses identity matrix for
    calibration.
    
    Also fixed variable shadowing which lead to wrong
    markers positions (were either zero or undefined).

    - Existing test ApplyIsInvertibleSimple was not

      was ininvertible.
    
      Tweaked parameters in a way model is invertible now.
    
    - Added some own tests which tests;
    
      * Principal point always maps from pixel space to
        zero normalized position.
    
      * Some basic tests to check whether individual
        apply/invert works correct.

    Switch from DENSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY to DENSE_QR
    
    DENSE_QR is better behaved numerically and after recent
    changes from Sameer there's no big difference in speed.

    Modal (aka tripod) solver rework
    
    Several major things are done in this commit:
    
    - First of all, logic of modal solver was changed.
      We do not rely on only minimizer to take care of
      guessing rotation for frame, but we're using
      analytical rotation computation for point clouds
      to obtain initial rotation.
    
      Then this rotation is being refined using Ceres
      minimizer and now instead of minimizing average
      distance between points of point of two clouds,
      minimization of reprojection error of point
      cloud onto frame happens.
    
      This gives quite a bit of precision improvement.
    
    - Second bigger improvement here is using bundle
      adjustment for a result of first step when we're
      only estimating rotation between neighbor images
      and reprojecting markers.
    
      This averages error across the image sequence
      avoiding error accumulation. Also, this will
      tweak bundles themselves a bit for better match.
    
    - And last bigger improvement here is support of
      camera intrinsics refirenment.
    
    This allowed to significantly improve solution
    for real-life footage and results after such
    refining are much more usable than it were before.
    
    Thanks to Keir for the help and code review!

    Increase verbosity level for reprojected markers info
    
    This information is useful, but in cases when you, say,
    working on a bundler it's annoying to scroll all the
    information up.
