    Made FAST detector optional
    
    This way it's possible to bundle Libmv sources subset
    to applications which doesn't need FAST detector.
    
    Mainly this is done for Blender integration.

    Implemented scoped_array and use it in detector
    
    scoped_array is pretty much the same as scoped_ptr
    with the only difference that it'll free memory using
    delete[] operator.
    
    It also gives some additional API functions to access
    array elements.
    
    Currently it only used to manage images denoted as byte
    arrays in detector.

    Improvements to weighted tracks behavior
    
    First thing changed by this commit is making it so
    Euclidean intersection takes track weight into account
    when solving minimization problem. This behaves the
    same exact way as it is for BA step.
    
    Second thing is related on how average reprojection error
    is being calculated. It didn't take track weight into
    account which could confuse users. Now average reprojection
    error will give the same result as intersection/BA uses
    during minimization which gives much more predictable
    behavior.

    Fixes for keyframe selection
    
    Using tracks with constant zero weight used to crash
    keyframe selection since it was trying to use missing
    parameter blocks for Jacobian evaluation,
    
    Also fixed possible issues with wrong camera block being
    marked as variable. This could technically happen when
    having zero weighted tracks. Made it so all camera blocks
    are marked as variable for now.

    Rework detector API and implement Harris detector
    
    Switch the detector API to a single function which accepts
    a float image and detector options. This makes usage of
    feature detection more unified across different algorithms.
    
    Options structure is pretty much straightforward and contains
    detector to be used and all the detector-specific settings.
    
    Also implemented Harris feature detection algorithm which
    is not as fast as FAST one but is expected to detect more
    robust feature points.

    Eagerly attempt to refine a track before doing a brute search
    
    Before the refinement phase of tracking, a brute force SAD search
    is run across the search area. This works well but is slow;
    especially if the guess for the track's location is accurate.
    
    This patch runs a refinement phase before running a brute force
    search, hoping that the guessed position (in x2, y2) is close to
    the best answer. If it is, then no brute search is done. If it is
    not, then a normal brute force search followed by refinement is
    done.
    
    In some cases this may produce worse tracks than before; the
    regressions will need investigation. The predictive motion model
    (to be implemented) will reduce the probability of that happening.

    Fix bug where libmv tracking incorrectly succeeds on failure
    
    Before this patch, if Ceres returned USER_SUCCESS indicating that
    Ceres was only changing the tracked quad slightly between
    iterations (indicating convergence), no final correlation check
    was done. This leads to incorrectly returning that the tracking
    was successful, when it actually failed.

    In the future we might want to switch resection to PPnP algorithm,

    Implement refinement of estimated homography/fundamental matrices
    
    It was only possible to perform algebraic estimation, which didn't
    give so much accurate results.
    
    Implemented a way to perform algebraic estimation followed with
    refinement step using Ceres minimizer.
    
    The code was actually mostly already there since keyframe selection
    patch. Made such estimation a generic function in multiview/ and
    hanged API for estimation in order to pass all additional options via
    an options structure (the same way as it's done fr Ceres).
    
    Most of the options are straight-forward to understand,but some
    deserves more description here:
    
    * expected_average_symmetric_distance is used as an early output check
      and as soon as average symmetric error goes below this threshold
      refining finishes.
    
      This distance is measured in the same units as input points are.
    
      It is arguable whether we need callback for this or not, but seems
      Ceres doesn't have some kind of absolute threshold for function value
      and function_tolerance behaves different from logic behind expected
      symmetric error.
    
    * There' an option to normalize correspondences before estimating the
      homography in order to increase estimation stability. See

        Vision. Cambridge University Press, second edition, 2003.

    Add Procrustes PNP ("PPnP") resection algorithm to libmv
    
    This adds a new Euclidean resection method, used to create the
    initial reconstruction in the motion tracker, to libmv. The method
    is based on the Procrustes PNP algorithm (aka "PPnP"). Currently
    the algorithm is not connected with the motion tracker, but it
    will be eventually since it supports initialization.
    
    Having an initial guess when doing resection is important for
    ambiguous cases where potentially the user could offer extra
    guidance to the solver, in the form of "this point is in front of
    that point".

    Keyframe selection improvements
    
    Added additional criteria, which ignores
    keyframe pair if success intersection factor
    is lower than current candidate pair factor.
    
    This solves issue with keyframe pair at which
    most of the tracks are intersecting behind the
    camera is accepted (because variance in this
    case is really small),
    
    Also tweaked generalized inverse function,
    which now doesn't scale epsilon by maximal
    matrix element. This gave issues at really bad
    candidates with unstable covariance. In this
    case almost all eigen values getting zeroed
    on inverse leading to small expected error.

    Optimization for reconstruction variance
    
    Achieved by replacing SVD-based pseudo-inverse with
    an eigen solver pseudo inverse.
    
    New function works in the same way: it decomposes
    matrix to V*D*V^-1, then inverts diagonal of D
    and composes matrix back.
    
    The same way is used to deal with gauges - last
    7 eigen values are getting zeroed.
    
    In own tests gives approx 2x boost, without
    visible affect on selected keyframe quality.

    Initial commit of reconstruction variance criteria
    which is an addition for GRIC-based keyframe selection.
    
    Uses paper Keyframe Selection for Camera Motion and Structure
    Estimation from Multiple Views,
    ftp://ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de/pub/papers/2004/ECCV2004-TTHBAW.pdf
    as a basis.
    
    Currently implemented camera positions reconstructions,
    bundle positions estimation and bundle adjustment step.
    
    Covariance matrix is estimating using generalized inverse
    with 7 (by the number of gauge freedoms) zeroed eigen values
    of J^T * J.
    
    Additional changes:
    - Added utility function FundamentalToEssential to extract
      E from F matrix, used by both final reconstruction pipeline
      and reconstruction variance code.
    
    - Refactored bundler a bit, so now it's possible to return
      different evaluation data, such as number of cameras and
      points being minimized and also jacobian.
    
      Jacobian currently contains only camera and points columns,
      no intrinsics there yet. It is also currently converting to
      an Eigen dense matrix. A bit weak, but speed is nice for
      tests.
    
      Columns in jacobian are ordered in the following way:
      first columns are cameras (3 cols for rotation and 3 cols
      for translation), then goes 3D point columns.
    
    - Switched F and H refining to normalized space. Apparently,
      refining F in pixel space squeezes it a lot making it wrong.
    
    - EuclideanIntersect will not add point to reconstruction if
      it happened to be behind the camera.
    
    - Cleaned style a bit.

    Add check for points behind camera in euclidan BA cost functor
    
    In cases keyframes are no so good, algebraic two frames construction
    could produce result, for which more aggressive Ceres-based BA code
    will fall to a solution for which points goes behind the camera,
    which is not so nice.
    
    Seems in newer Ceres returning false from cost functor wouldn't
    abort solution, but will restrict solver from moving points behind
    the camera.
    
    Works fine in own tests, but requires more tests.

    Use epsilon in modal solver test
    
    Default epsilon for isApprox was too small,
    leading to some false test failures.

    Fix for bundle adjusting with motion restricted
    
    Was a bug introduced in previous commit, which
    was trying to set parameterization for non-existing
    camera->t parameter block.
    
    Replaced with subset parameterization.
    
    Also added basic synthetic unit test for modal solver.

     Bundle adjustment improvements
    
    - Get rid of rotation matrix parameterization,
      use angle-axis instead.
    
      Also Joined rotation and translation into
      a single parameter block.
    
      This made minimization go significantly faster,
      like 1.3x times in average.
    
    - Fix first camera when bundling. This is to
      address orientation ambiguity.
    
      Reconstruction result could still vary in
      size, but that's another issue to be addressed
      later.
    
    Additional change:
    
    Split EuclideanBundleCommonIntrinsics into
    smaller functions, so it's now a bit easier
    to follow.

    Corrected path to gflags
    
    Currently tools/track.cc is not used, but let's
    keep things a bit more up-to-date :)

    Re-enable tests for multiview and image
    
    For as long code is in repo and used by some tools
    better to have it covered by tests.
    
    Some of them are failing tho, but that's completely
    different story to be addressed later.

    Do not modify cache's CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE when configuring Ceres
    
    Otherwise you'll have infinite appending of Ceres-specific flags
    on every saving of any CmakeLists.txt.

    Fixed compilation with BUILD_TOOLS enabled
    
    This commit mainly reverts parts of following commits:
        0eebc21db831211738acc938566bbc29d68d45db
        d8109b7a4fede1660e0dbd73735f1a9e3fd79eec

        2d6cd58ee1cd7c5073980f358c71b2898ad16b4c
    
    They declared  lots of stuff deprecated, but in
    fact it's not deprecated just a bit different
    usage pipeline. Anyway, deprecation shall not
    happen spontaneously as a part of other changes.
    And for sure shall not break anything.
