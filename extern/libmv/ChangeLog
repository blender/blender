    implement backward prediction
    
    The title actually says it all, just extend current implementation
    of PredictMarkerPosition() to cases when tracking happens in the reverse
    order (from the end frame to start).
    
    it's still doesn't solve all the ambiguity happening in the function
    in cases when one tracks the feature and then re-tracks it in order
    to refine the sliding. This is considered a separate TODO for now and
    will likely be solved by passing tracking direction to the prediction
    function.

    block constant.

    Fix search area sliding issue
    
    The only way to do this is to store search region in floats
    and round when we need to sample it. Otherwise you'll always
    have sliding effect caused by rounding the issues, especially
    when doing incremental offset (thing which happens in the
    prediction code).
    
    Pretty much straightforward change apart from stuff to be kept
    in mind: offset calculation int should happen relative to the
    rounded search region. This is because tracker works in the space
    of the search window image which get's rounded on the frame access,
    
    This makes API a bit creepy because frame accessor uses the same
    Region struct as the search window in Marker and ideally we would
    need to have either IntRegion or Region<int> in order to make
    Libmv fully track on what's getting rounded and when.

    Support multiple distortion models, including a new division model
    
    This commit makes it so CameraIntrinsics is no longer hardcoded
    to use the traditional polynomial radial distortion model. Currently
    the distortion code has generic logic which is shared between
    different distortion models, but had no other models until now.
    
    This moves everything specific to the polynomial radial distortion
    to a subclass PolynomialDistortionCameraIntrinsics(), and adds a
    new division distortion model suitable for cameras such as the
    GoPro which have much stronger distortion due to their fisheye lens.
    
    This also cleans up the internal API of CameraIntrinsics to make
    it easier to understand and reduces old C-style code.

    Fix failure of the image transform linear test
    
    Mainly was caused by the flakyness of image rotation in cases

    code to rotate the image around pixel corner, which isn't a

    is usually done around the pixel center.
    
    So now made it so RotateImage() rotates the image around the
    pixel center which gives 100% proper result for odd sized images
    (i.e. center pixel stays untouched).

    Tweaks to make bundling into Blender warning-less
    
    Mainly issue i caused by conflicts in include directories,
    so glog used to include config.h from gflags. It might be
    fixed by splitting gflags/glog from Libmv in Blender build
    system but that's not something fun to work on. Fixed by
    making include directories  bit more explicit.
    
    Also solved no-previous-prototype warnings.

    Raise epsilon used for model solver test
    
    It was too much small leading to false failure triggering
    caused simply by precision issues.

    Made it possible to link against Ceres installed on the system
    
    Main purpose of this is to get away from bundled Ceres library
    which is not so trivial to re-bundle and takes some to do this
    (not talking about CMake options conflicts and pollution).
    
    Enabled by setting WITH_SYSTEM_CERES=ON. Default paths to search
    Ceres library:
    
    - /usr/local
    - /sw
    - /opt/local
    - /opt/csw
    - /opt/lib/ceres
    
    You might also specify Ceres root directory using CERES_ROOT_DIR
    variable (both CMake and environment variables are supported).
    
    If your Ceres is build statically, you're to control all additional
    libraries needed to link against using CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS.

    we've been having to support compilation on different platforms
    and compilers.

    Fix order of third party libs compilation and options used by them
    
    WITH_FAST_DETECTOR was defined too late and third_party folder
    didn't see this option.

    Disable Ceres unit tests and examples by default
    
    Actually we're to switch to external Ceres rather than
    bundled one, would make life much easier actually.
