    Fix for bundle adjusting with motion restricted
    
    Was a bug introduced in previous commit, which
    was trying to set parameterization for non-existing
    camera->t parameter block.
    
    Replaced with subset parameterization.
    
    Also added basic synthetic unit test for modal solver.

     Bundle adjustment improvements
    
    - Get rid of rotation matrix parameterization,
      use angle-axis instead.
    
      Also Joined rotation and translation into
      a single parameter block.
    
      This made minimization go significantly faster,
      like 1.3x times in average.
    
    - Fix first camera when bundling. This is to
      address orientation ambiguity.
    
      Reconstruction result could still vary in
      size, but that's another issue to be addressed
      later.
    
    Additional change:
    
    Split EuclideanBundleCommonIntrinsics into
    smaller functions, so it's now a bit easier
    to follow.

    happen spontaneously as a part of other changes.

    Revert "Change libmv's bilinear sampling to assume the same"
    
    Revert changes to bilinear sampler which were originally
    aimed to match blender's pixel center (where integer coord
    is a left-bottom corner, x.5 coords are centers.
    
    The reason of revert is changing this assumption in only
    sampler didn't work well and lead to wrong results of
    BlurredImageAndDerivativesChannels for example.
    
    Discovered when was doing unit-tests for brute region tracker.
    
    This reverts commit daa354c0735b954b0cd7725626e9a3d67416d46b.

    Tweak to KLT region tracker test
    
    KLT is usually used to track relatively small
    motions, and in this case motion almost equals
    to half window size. This confuses math and
    leads to not so much expected result.
    
    Further, not actually sure this is nice idea
    to use KLT in such synthetic case.

    Pyramid tracker unit test fix
    
    Issue was caused by trackers modifying guessed
    point location even in case of failure. So made
    id so both level 0 and level 3 of pyramid are
    starting from the same initial guessed location.
    
    Modifying locations in case tracker returns false
    is not actually a bug - someone could still want
    to use that location. False in this case  means
    more like "returned location is not so much
    accurate".

    Intersect unit test fix
    
    EuclideanIntersect is not aware of camera calibration
    matrix yet and always assumes it to be an identity.
    
    So using non-identity matrix to construct sample case
    leads to wrong projection results.
    
    For now made it so test case uses identity matrix for
    calibration.
    
    Also fixed variable shadowing which lead to wrong
    markers positions (were either zero or undefined).

    Camera intrinsics unit tests fixes
    
    - Existing test ApplyIsInvertibleSimple was not
      doing right thing - distortion model used there
      was ininvertible.
    
      Tweaked parameters in a way model is invertible now.
    
    - Added some own tests which tests;
    
      * Principal point always maps from pixel space to
        zero normalized position.
    
      * Some basic tests to check whether individual
        apply/invert works correct.

    Fix for TransformTracks in uncalibrated pipeline
    
    Transformation matrix was completely ignored by
    TransformTracks() and final marker coordinate
    exactly matched it's source coordinates.
    
    Seems to be just a typo in vector usage: need to
    use "b" (which is transformed one) instead of "a"
    when converting projective coordinate to 2D space.

    - Added unit tests data for ceres, otherwise system_test fails.
    
    - Restored "test" makefile target.

    Modal (aka tripod) solver rework
    
    Several major things are done in this commit:
    
    - First of all, logic of modal solver was changed.
      We do not rely on only minimizer to take care of
      guessing rotation for frame, but we're using
      analytical rotation computation for point clouds
      to obtain initial rotation.
    
      Then this rotation is being refined using Ceres
      minimizer and now instead of minimizing average
      distance between points of point of two clouds,
      minimization of reprojection error of point
      cloud onto frame happens.
    
      This gives quite a bit of precision improvement.
    
    - Second bigger improvement here is using bundle
      adjustment for a result of first step when we're
      only estimating rotation between neighbor images
      and reprojecting markers.
    
      This averages error across the image sequence
      avoiding error accumulation. Also, this will
      tweak bundles themselves a bit for better match.
    
    - And last bigger improvement here is support of
      camera intrinsics refirenment.
    
    This allowed to significantly improve solution
    for real-life footage and results after such
    refining are much more usable than it were before.
    
    Thanks to Keir for the help and code review!

    This information is useful, but in cases when you, say,
    working on a bundler it's annoying to scroll all the
    information up.

    Move radial distortion code to own templated function
    
    This shall not lead to any functional changes, just
    avoids radial distortion code duplicated in camera
    intrinsics and bundling code.
    
    For fancier bundle adjustment support of  different
    distortion models this is not actually enough and
    would need to make some bigger changes, but this
    changes makes code a bit easier to maintain already.

    Switch motion tracker bundle adjustment to Ceres.
    
    Patch originally written by me, then finished by Sergey. Big
    thanks to Sergey for troopering through and fixing the many issues
    with my original (not compilable) patch.
    
    The Ceres implementation uses 2 parameter blocks for each camera
    (1 for rotation and 1 for translation), 1 parameter block for
    common intrinsics (focal length etc) and 1 parameter block for
    each track (e.g. bundle or 3D point).
    
    We turn on some fancy optimizer options to get better performance,
    in particular:
    
      options.preconditioner_type = ceres::SCHUR_JACOBI;
      options.linear_solver_type = ceres::ITERATIVE_SCHUR;
      options.use_inner_iterations = true;
      options.use_nonmonotonic_steps = true;
      options.max_num_iterations = 100;
    
    Special thanks to Sameer Agarwal of Ceres fame for splitting out
    the SCHUR_JACOBI preconditioner so that it didn't depend on
    CHOLMOD.  Previously we could not use that preconditioner in
    Blender because CHOLMOD is too large of a dependency for Blender.
    
    BundleIntrinsicsLogMessage:
    - Moved bunch of if(foo) LG << "bar" into this function, to make

    Fixed for keyframe selection
    
    - Calculate residuals for GRIC in pixel space rather than
      in normalized space.
    
      This seems to be how it's intended to be used.
    
      Algebraic H and F will still use normalized coordinates which
      are more stable, after this matrices are converted to pixel
      space and Ceres refinement happens in pixel space.
    
    - Standard deviation calculation was wrong in GRIC. It shouldn't
      be deviation of residuals, but as per Torr it should be deviation
      of measurement error, which is constant (in our case 0.1)
    
      Not sure if using squared cost function is correct for GRIC,
      but cost function is indeed squared and in most papers cost
      function is used for GRIC. After some further tests we could
      switch GRIC residuals to non-squared distance.
    
    - Bring back rho part of GRIC, in unit tests it doesn't make
      sense whether it's enabled or not, lets see how it'll behave
      in real-life footage.
    
    - Added one more unit test based on elevator scene and manual
      keyframe selection.

    - Returned back squares to SymmetricEpipolarDistance and
      SymmetricGeometricDistance -- this is actually a cost
      functions, not distances and they shall be squared.

    Improvements for keyframe selection
    
    - Changed main keyframe selection cycle, so in cases there're no
      more next keyframes for current keyframe could be found in the
      image sequence, current keyframe would be moved forward and
      search continues.
    
      This helps in cases when there's poor motion in the beginning
      of the sequence, then markers becomes occluded. There could be
      good keyframes in the middle of the shot still.
    
    - Extended keyframe_selection_test with real world cases.
    
    - Moved correspondences constraint to the top, so no H/F estimation
      happens if there's bad correspondence. Makes algorithm go a bit
      faster.
    
    Strangely, but using non-squared distances makes neighbor frames
    test fail, using squared distances makes this tests pass.
    
    However, using non-squared distances seems to be working better
    in real tests i've been doing. So this requires more investigation/

    Cosmetic change to correspondences reports in keyframe selection

    Various fixes:
    
    - That was a typo in symmetric geometric cost functor, which
      computed inverse distance in a wrong way.
    
    - Fixed compilation of unit tests
    
    - Added simple test for keyframe selection. Currently only
      covers case that neighbor frames with only translation
      (homography should be better than fundamental) are not
      considered a keyframes.
    
      Still need to be investigated why it only works if tracks
      are in pixel space and why doesn't work in normalized space.

    Assorted fixes for keyframe selection:
    
    - Biggest error was in cost functors used for F and H refirement,
      they were just wrong.
    
    - Use natural logarithms, since it's actually makes sense from
      math papers point of view and error is somewhere else.
    
    - Disabled rho for GRIC, for now use non-clamped error for tests.
    
    - Made SymmetricEpipolarDistance returning non-squared distance
      Keyframe selection is currently the only used of this function
      and it seems using non-squared distance makes much more sense.
    
      Also would think to append suffix "Squared" to functions which
      returns squared distances.
    
    - Removed templated version of SymmetricEpipolarDistance, since
      it's not needed actually.
    
    This is actually even worse working than previous implementation,
    but commit it needed for further review.

    Euclidean resection cost function didn't use correct constructor
    
    It was storing a reference to initial rotation passed by value,
    leading to pointer being pointing to a stack variable, leading to
    wrong memory access in residuals computing.
    
    Apparently was visible in optimized builds only with inline
    substitution allowed.

    Automatic keyframe selection based on Pollefeys's criteria
    
    This commit implements automatic keyframe selection algorithm
    based on Pollefeys's criteria (F-GRIC is smaller than H-GRIC
    and correspondence ratio is more then 90%).
    
    It is implemented as a part of simple pipeline and returns
    vector of keyframe images for a given Tracks structure.
    
    For simple pipeline reconstruction two best keyframes are
    expected to be selected from all detected candidates.
    Criteria for this selection could be reprojection error of
    solution from two candidate keyfames.
    
    Unfortunately, it's not fully workable yet, hopefully would
    be fixed soon.

    Camera Tracking: allow fallback to reprojection resection
    by user demand
    
    This fixes some "regressions" introduced in previous commit
    which lead to much worse solution in some cases. Now it's
    possible to bring old behavior back.
    
    Perhaps it's more like temporal solution for time being smarter
    solution is found. But finding such a solution isn't so fast,
    so let's bring manual control over reprojection usage.
    
    But anyway, imo it's now nice to have a structure which could
    be used to pass different settings to the solver.
