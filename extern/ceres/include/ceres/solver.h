    // Ceres supports the two major families of optimization strategies -
    // Trust Region and Line Search.
    //
    // 1. The line search approach first finds a descent direction
    // along which the objective function will be reduced and then
    // computes a step size that decides how far should move along
    // that direction. The descent direction can be computed by
    // various methods, such as gradient descent, Newton's method and
    // Quasi-Newton method. The step size can be determined either
    // exactly or inexactly.
    //
    // 2. The trust region approach approximates the objective
    // function using using a model function (often a quadratic) over
    // a subset of the search space known as the trust region. If the
    // model function succeeds in minimizing the true objective
    // function the trust region is expanded; conversely, otherwise it
    // is contracted and the model optimization problem is solved
    // again.
    //
    // Trust region methods are in some sense dual to line search methods:
    // trust region methods first choose a step size (the size of the
    // trust region) and then a step direction while line search methods
    // first choose a step direction and then a step size.

    // complexity of using the approximation. Higher the rank, the
    // better is the quality of the approximation. The increase in
    // quality is however is bounded for a number of reasons.
    //
    // 1. The method only uses secant information and not actual
    // derivatives.
    //
    // 2. The Hessian approximation is constrained to be positive

    // So increasing this rank to a large number will cost time and

    // Cholesky factor with O(n) storage, where as a bad ordering will
    // result in an completely dense factor.
    //
    // Ceres allows the user to provide varying amounts of hints to
    // the solver about the variable elimination ordering to use. This
    // can range from no hints, where the solver is free to decide the
    // best possible ordering based on the user's choices like the
    // linear solver being used, to an exact order in which the
    // variables should be eliminated, and a variety of possibilities
    // in between.
    //
    // Instances of the ParameterBlockOrdering class are used to
    // communicate this information to Ceres.

    // Formally an ordering is an ordered partitioning of the
    // parameter blocks, i.e, each parameter block belongs to exactly
    // one group, and each group has a unique non-negative integer
    // associated with it, that determines its order in the set of
    // groups.
    //
    // Given such an ordering, Ceres ensures that the parameter blocks in
    // the lowest numbered group are eliminated first, and then the
    // parmeter blocks in the next lowest numbered group and so on. Within
    // each group, Ceres is free to order the parameter blocks as it
    // chooses.
    //
    // If NULL, then all parameter blocks are assumed to be in the
    // same group and the solver is free to decide the best
    // ordering.
    //
    // e.g. Consider the linear system
    //
    //   x + y = 3
    //   2x + 3y = 7
    //
    // There are two ways in which it can be solved. First eliminating x
    // from the two equations, solving for y and then back substituting
    // for x, or first eliminating y, solving for x and back substituting
    // for y. The user can construct three orderings here.
    //
    //   {0: x}, {1: y} - eliminate x first.
    //   {0: y}, {1: x} - eliminate y first.
    //   {0: x, y}      - Solver gets to decide the elimination order.
    //
    // Thus, to have Ceres determine the ordering automatically using
    // heuristics, put all the variables in group 0 and to control the
    // ordering for every variable, create groups 0..N-1, one per
    // variable, in the desired order.
    //
    // Bundle Adjustment
    // -----------------
    //
    // A particular case of interest is bundle adjustment, where the user
    // has two options. The default is to not specify an ordering at all,
    // the solver will see that the user wants to use a Schur type solver
    // and figure out the right elimination ordering.
    //
    // But if the user already knows what parameter blocks are points and
    // what are cameras, they can save preprocessing time by partitioning
    // the parameter blocks into two groups, one for the points and one
    // for the cameras, where the group containing the points has an id

    // various algorithms for solving separable non-linear least
    // squares problems and refer to "Variable Projection" as
    // Algorithm I in their paper.
    //
    // Implementing Variable Projection is tedious and expensive, and
    // they present a simpler algorithm, which they refer to as
    // Algorithm II, where once the Newton/Trust Region step has been
    // computed for the whole problem (a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2, c_1) and
    // additional optimization step is performed to estimate a_1 and
    // a_2 exactly.
    //
    // This idea can be generalized to cases where the residual is not
    // linear in a_1 and a_2, i.e., Solve for the trust region step
    // for the full problem, and then use it as the starting point to
    // further optimize just a_1 and a_2. For the linear case, this
    // amounts to doing a single linear least squares solve. For
    // non-linear problems, any method for solving the a_1 and a_2
    // optimization problems will do. The only constraint on a_1 and
    // a_2 is that they do not co-occur in any residual block.
    //
    // This idea can be further generalized, by not just optimizing
    // (a_1, a_2), but decomposing the graph corresponding to the
    // Hessian matrix's sparsity structure in a collection of
    // non-overlapping independent sets and optimizing each of them.
    //
    // Setting "use_inner_iterations" to true enables the use of this
    // non-linear generalization of Ruhe & Wedin's Algorithm II.  This
    // version of Ceres has a higher iteration complexity, but also
    // displays better convergence behaviour per iteration. Setting
    // Solver::Options::num_threads to the maximum number possible is

    // If inner_iterations is true, then the user has two choices.

    //    Solver::Options::inner_iteration_ordering untouched.
    //
    // 2. Specify a collection of of ordered independent sets. Where
