  // If sq_norm = 0.0, the correction becomes trivial, the residual
  // and the jacobian are scaled by the squareroot of the derivative
  // of rho. Handling this case explicitly avoids the divide by zero
  // error that would occur below.
  //
  // The case where rho'' < 0 also gets special handling. Technically
  // it shouldn't, and the computation of the scaling should proceed
  // as below, however we found in experiments that applying the
  // curvature correction when rho'' < 0, which is the case when we
  // are in the outlier region slows down the convergence of the
  // algorithm significantly.
  //
  // Thus, we have divided the action of the robustifier into two
  // parts. In the inliner region, we do the full second order
  // correction which re-wights the gradient of the function by the
  // square root of the derivative of rho, and the Gauss-Newton
  // Hessian gets both the scaling and the rank-1 curvature
  // correction. Normaly, alpha is upper bounded by one, but with this
  // change, alpha is bounded above by zero.
  //
  // Empirically we have observed that the full Triggs correction and
  // the clamped correction both start out as very good approximations
  // to the loss function when we are in the convex part of the
  // function, but as the function starts transitioning from convex to
  // concave, the Triggs approximation diverges more and more and
  // ultimately becomes linear. The clamped Triggs model however
  // remains quadratic.
  //
  // The reason why the Triggs approximation becomes so poor is
  // because the curvature correction that it applies to the gauss
  // newton hessian goes from being a full rank correction to a rank
  // deficient correction making the inversion of the Hessian fraught
  // with all sorts of misery and suffering.
  //
  // The clamped correction retains its quadratic nature and inverting it
  // is always well formed.
