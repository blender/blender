// - Upcasting in a type hierarchy.

// In general, implicit_cast can be used to convert this code

// When you upcast (that is, cast a pointer from type Foo to type
// SuperclassOfFoo), it's fine to use implicit_cast<>, since upcasts
// always succeed.  When you downcast (that is, cast a pointer from
// type Foo to type SubclassOfFoo), static_cast<> isn't safe, because
// how do you know the pointer is really of type SubclassOfFoo?  It
// could be a bare Foo, or of type DifferentSubclassOfFoo.  Thus,
// when you downcast, you should use this macro.  In debug mode, we
// use dynamic_cast<> to double-check the downcast is legal (we die
// if it's not).  In normal mode, we do the efficient static_cast<>
// instead.  Thus, it's important to test in debug mode to make sure
// the cast is legal!
//    This is the only place in the code we should use dynamic_cast<>.
// In particular, you SHOULDN'T be using dynamic_cast<> in order to
// do RTTI (eg code like this:
//    if (dynamic_cast<Subclass1>(foo)) HandleASubclass1Object(foo);
//    if (dynamic_cast<Subclass2>(foo)) HandleASubclass2Object(foo);
// You should design the code some other way not to need this.

  // Ensures that To is a sub-type of From *.  This test is here only
  // for compile-time type checking, and has no overhead in an
  // optimized build at run-time, as it will be optimized away
  // completely.
