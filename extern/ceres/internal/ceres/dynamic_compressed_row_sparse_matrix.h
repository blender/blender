// A compressed row sparse matrix that provides an extended interface to
// allow dynamic insertion of entries. This is provided for the use case
// where the sparsity structure and number of non-zero entries is dynamic.
// This flexibility is achieved by using an (internal) scratch space that
// allows independent insertion of entries into each row (thread-safe).
// Once insertion is complete, the `Finalize` method must be called to ensure
// that the underlying `CompressedRowSparseMatrix` is consistent.
//
// This should only be used if you really do need a dynamic sparsity pattern.
