// This class implements an iterative solver for the linear least
// squares problems that have a bi-partite sparsity structure common
// to Structure from Motion problems.
//
// The algorithm used by this solver was developed in a series of
// papers - "Agarwal et al, Bundle Adjustment in the Large, ECCV 2010"
// and "Wu et al, Multicore Bundle Adjustment, submitted to CVPR
// 2011" at the Univeristy of Washington.
//
// The key idea is that one can run Conjugate Gradients on the Schur
// Complement system without explicitly forming the Schur Complement
// in memory. The heavy lifting for this is done by the
// ImplicitSchurComplement class. Not forming the Schur complement in
// memory and factoring it results in substantial savings in time and
// memory. Further, iterative solvers like this open up the
// possibility of solving the Newton equations in a non-linear solver
// only approximately and terminating early, thereby saving even more
// time.
//
// For the curious, running CG on the Schur complement is the same as
// running CG on the Normal Equations with an SSOR preconditioner. For
// a proof of this fact and others related to this solver please see
// the section on Domain Decomposition Methods in Saad's book
// "Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems".
