// radial robust loss.

// The key idea here is to look at the expressions for the robustified
// gauss newton approximation and then take its squareroot to get the
// corresponding corrections to the residual and jacobian.  For the
// full expressions see Eq. 10 and 11 in BANS by Triggs et al.

  // the constants that are needed to apply the correction. The
  // correction constant alpha is constrained to be smaller than 1, if
  // it becomes larger than 1, then it will reverse the sign of the
  // residual and the correction. If alpha is equal to 1 will result
  // in a divide by zero error. Thus we constrain alpha to be upper
  // bounded by 1 - epsilon_.
  //
  // rho[1] needs to be positive. The constructor will crash if this
  // condition is not met.
