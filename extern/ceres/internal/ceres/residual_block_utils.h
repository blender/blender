// Utility routines for ResidualBlock evaluation.
//
// These are useful for detecting two common class of errors.
//
// 1. Uninitialized memory - where the user for some reason did not
// compute part of a cost/residual/jacobian.
//
// 2. Numerical failure while computing the cost/residual/jacobian,
// e.g. NaN, infinities etc. This is particularly useful since the
// automatic differentiation code does computations that are not
// evident to the user and can silently generate hard to debug errors.
