// This class implements the now classical Conjugate Gradients
// algorithm of Hestenes & Stiefel for solving postive semidefinite
// linear sytems. Optionally it can use a preconditioner also to
// reduce the condition number of the linear system and improve the
// convergence rate. Modern references for Conjugate Gradients are the
// books by Yousef Saad and Trefethen & Bau. This implementation of CG
// has been augmented with additional termination tests that are
// needed for forcing early termination when used as part of an
// inexact Newton solver.
//
// For more details see the documentation for
// LinearSolver::PerSolveOptions::r_tolerance and
// LinearSolver::PerSolveOptions::q_tolerance in linear_solver.h.
