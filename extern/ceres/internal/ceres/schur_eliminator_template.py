#
# Script for explicitly generating template specialization of the
# SchurEliminator class. It is a rather large class
# and the number of explicit instantiations is also large. Explicitly
# generating these instantiations in separate .cc files breaks the
# compilation into separate compilation unit rather than one large cc
# file which takes 2+GB of RAM to compile.
#
# This script creates two sets of files.
#
# 1. schur_eliminator_x_x_x.cc
# where, the x indicates the template parameters and
#
# 2. schur_eliminator.cc
#
# that contains a factory function for instantiating these classes
# based on runtime parameters.
#
# The list of tuples, specializations indicates the set of
# specializations that is generated.

# Set of template specializations to generate
