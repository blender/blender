// The job of the TrustRegionStepEvaluator is to evaluate the quality
// of a step, i.e., how the cost of a step compares with the reduction
// in the objective of the trust region problem.
//
// Classic trust region methods are descent methods, in that they only
// accept a point if it strictly reduces the value of the objective
// function. They do this by measuring the quality of a step as
//
//   cost_change / model_cost_change.
//
// Relaxing the monotonic descent requirement allows the algorithm to
// be more efficient in the long term at the cost of some local
// increase in the value of the objective function.
//
// This is because allowing for non-decreasing objective function
// values in a principled manner allows the algorithm to "jump over
// boulders" as the method is not restricted to move into narrow
// valleys while preserving its convergence properties.
//
// The parameter max_consecutive_nonmonotonic_steps controls the
// window size used by the step selection algorithm to accept
// non-monotonic steps. Setting this parameter to zero, recovers the
// classic montonic descent algorithm.
//
// Based on algorithm 10.1.2 (page 357) of "Trust Region
// Methods" by Conn Gould & Toint, or equations 33-40 of
// "Non-monotone trust-region algorithms for nonlinear
// optimization subject to convex constraints" by Phil Toint,
// Mathematical Programming, 77, 1997.
//
// Example usage:
//
// TrustRegionStepEvaluator* step_evaluator = ...
//
// cost = ... // Compute the non-linear objective function value.
// model_cost_change = ... // Change in the value of the trust region objective.
// if (step_evaluator->StepQuality(cost, model_cost_change) > threshold) {
//   x = x + delta;
//   step_evaluator->StepAccepted(cost, model_cost_change);
// }
