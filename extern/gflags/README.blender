  further tweaks:

  * OS_WINDOWS need to be conditinally defined from inside #ifdef WIN32
  * Same applies yo HAVE_SHLWAPI_H
  * Disabeld HAVE_FNMATCH_H

- Removed attribute(unused) from FlagSaver.

- Applied some modifications from fork https://github.com/Nazg-Gul/gflags.git
  (see https://github.com/gflags/gflags/pull/129)

- Avoid attempt of acquiring mutex lock in FlagRegistry::GlobalRegistry when
  doing static flags initialization. See d81dd2d in Blender repository.

- Made `google::{anonymous}::FlagValue::ValueSize() const` inlined, so it does
  not trigger strict compiler warning.
