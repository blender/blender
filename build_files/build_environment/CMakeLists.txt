# This is a build system used by platform maintainers to build library dependencies.
# For users building Blender, we recommend using the pre-compiled libraries from `lib/`
# on all platforms.
#
# This CMake project is usually built through wrappers:
# * Windows: `build_files/build_environment/windows/build_deps.cmd`.
# * macOS and Linux: `make deps` from the blender directory.
