      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
      that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
      revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
      behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
   reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
   Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
   non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
   this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
   import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
   those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
   infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
   Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
   If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
   Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
   patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
   License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
   filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
   Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and
   in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
      copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
      from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
      distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include
      a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
      file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
      Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
      NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
      Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
      Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
      NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
      License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
      that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from
      the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
      construed as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
      provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
      reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
      Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
      distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
      this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
   Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
   Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without
   any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
   herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement
   you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except
   as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
   Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
   writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
   Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
   warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
   the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
   associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
   in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
   applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
   in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
   any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
   to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
   commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
   the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
   acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
   and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
   obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
   responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
   agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
   liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
   reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. END OF

Creative Commons Legal Code

CC0 1.0 Universal CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT
PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN
"AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS
DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
   Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:

      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;

      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;

      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;

      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
   Statement of Purpose.

   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 , USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
   of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
   program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
   or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
   Program does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
   as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
   may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
      or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
      to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
      terms of this License.

      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
      copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
      but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
      Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
   reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
   as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
   the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
   licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
   regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
   the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
   based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
   or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
   the object code.

   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
   and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
   as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
   the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
   licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
   either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
   Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
   this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
   whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
   permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
   exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
   THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
   OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <yyyy> <name of author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 , USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software,
and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change

can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for

these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)

this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
   of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
   program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
   or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
   Program does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
   as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
   may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
      or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
      to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
      terms of this License.

      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
      copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
      but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
      Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
   reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
   as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
   the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
   licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
   regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
   the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
   based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
   or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
   the object code.

   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
   and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
   as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
   the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
   licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
   either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
   Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
   this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
   whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
   permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
   exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
   THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
   OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

< one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. >

Copyright (C) < yyyy > < name of author >

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 , USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software,
and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

< signature of Ty Coon > , 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice This General
Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary
programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more
useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is
what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this
License.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 , USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
   placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
   of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
   program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
   or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
   containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
   translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
   is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
   contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
   made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
   Program does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
   as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
   the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
   may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
      or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
      to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
      terms of this License.

      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
      run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
      the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
      copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
      but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
      Program is not required to print an announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be
   reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
   as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
   the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
   licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
   regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
   the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
   based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
   or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
   and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
      for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
      object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
      Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
   the object code.

   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
   copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
   and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
   recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
   as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
   the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
   licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
   either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
   Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
   this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
   whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
   permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
   Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
   exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
   THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
   OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software

this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software,

parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http s ://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most
of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake,
the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their
problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
   Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be
   individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
   copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work
   or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
   Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
   would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
   applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a
   private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without
   modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other
   activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties
   to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer
   network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the
   extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that
   (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
   there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
   provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
   view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
   commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
   criterion.

   1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
   widely used among developers working in that language.

   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than
   the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a
   Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)
   serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to
   implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to
   the public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means
   a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
   specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
   compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run
   it.

   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run
   the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those
   activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or
   general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
   unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the
   work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
   associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
   libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically
   designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow
   between those subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
   automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

   2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
   on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
   This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the
   unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by
   this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered
   work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent,
   as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
   without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You
   may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make
   modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for
   running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License
   in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus
   making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your
   behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
   making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
   with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it
   unnecessary.

   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure
   under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
   copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or
   restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is
   effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered
   work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of
   the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third
   parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
   it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
   on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices
   stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
   section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any
   warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the
   Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you
   may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce
   it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section
   4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
      and giving a relevant date.

      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
      under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
      requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
      notices".

      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
      anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
      apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole
      of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
      License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it
      does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need
      not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,
   which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are
   not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of
   a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
   compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or
   legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
   permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
   License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
   sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
   Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used
      for software interchange.

      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
      (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
      offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
      spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone
      who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding
      Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this
      License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software
      interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically
      performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
      Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
      offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed
      only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the
      object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
      (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further
      charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source
      along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a
      network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server
      (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
      facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object
      code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what
      server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure
      that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
      inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the
      work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
      subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from
   the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in
   conveying the object code work.

   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
   tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or
   household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into
   a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful
   cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product
   received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common
   use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular
   user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or
   is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless
   of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
   non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of
   use of the product.

   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
   authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute
   modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified
   version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure
   that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case
   prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of
   a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product
   is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term
   (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding
   Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation
   Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any
   third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
   Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for
   a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
   Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may
   be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
   operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
   communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in
   accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented
   (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),
   and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or
   copying.

   7. Additional Terms.

   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License
   by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
   permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as
   though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid
   under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the
   Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
   entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
   additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
   additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
   permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases
   when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material,
   added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
   copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to
   a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
   material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
      of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
      attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
      displayed by works containing it; or

      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
      requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable
      ways as different from the original version; or

      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
      authors of the material; or

      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
      names, trademarks, or service marks; or

      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
      anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
      contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability
      that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and
      authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
   restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
   governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
   you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further
   restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may
   add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
   document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
   relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
   place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms
   that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the
   applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of
   a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
   requirements apply either way.

   8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided
   under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,
   and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including
   any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from
   a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and
   until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license,
   and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the
   violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
   reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
   violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you
   cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
   License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated,
   you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under
   section 10.

   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
   copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
   solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy
   likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this
   License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These
   actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so.

   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
   license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
   subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
   third parties with this License.

   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
   results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who
   receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
   party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous
   paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the
   work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get
   it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
   granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a
   license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under
   this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim
   or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by
   making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
   portion of it.

   11. Patents.

   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License
   of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus
   licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
   controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License,
   of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include
   claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification
   of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, "control"
   includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with
   the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
   offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents
   of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
   as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for
   patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to
   make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
   party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
   Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free
   of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available
   network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
   cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
   yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or
   (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License,
   to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying"
   means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
   conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the
   covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents
   in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,
   you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
   grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work
   authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the
   covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to
   all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope
   of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
   non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted
   under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to
   an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing
   software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the
   extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third
   party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from
   you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the
   covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b)
   primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
   contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that
   patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
   available to you under applicable patent law.

   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
   not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
   to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the
   Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License
   would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to
   link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
   GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey
   the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the
   part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU
   Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a
   network will apply to the combination as such.

   14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
   GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
   similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License
   "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the
   terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
   version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
   ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
   the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
   acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version
   for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
   However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
   holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
   SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
   SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
   ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE
   PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
   GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
   OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
   OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
   PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
   EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
   SUCH DAMAGES.

   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above
   cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing
   courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute
   waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a
   warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
   return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
this program. If not, see <http s ://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might
be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http s
://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead
of this License. But first, please read <http s ://www.gnu.org/ licenses
/why-not-lgpl.html>.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301
    USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version
number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can
change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other
code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes
to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of
the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
   which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
   party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General
   Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as
   "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
   as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
   those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
   been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
   either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
   say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
   with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
   language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the
   term "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
   modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the
   source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
   installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
   by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program
   using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is
   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
   (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
   that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
   the Library does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
   that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and
   distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
   may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
   thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
   also meet all of these conditions:

      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
      all third parties under the terms of this License.

      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
      of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,
      other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you
      must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
      does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and
      performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

   (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
   that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
   Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
   by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
   the square root function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
   sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
   reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
   this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
   distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
   as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of
   the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
   licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
   regardless of who wrote it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
   the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
   based on the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
   the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
   or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
   License.

   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
   instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
   alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
   ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
   (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
   wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,
   so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies
   and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
   into a program that is not a library.

   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
   it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
   corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
   the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
   software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
   designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
   from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
   the object code.

   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but
   is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
   called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
   derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of
   this License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
   executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions
   of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable
   is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
   distribution of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
   part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work
   of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
   especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
   the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
   precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
   lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
   regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
   containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall
   under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
   the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
   containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
   linked directly with the Library itself.

   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
   "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
   portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your
   choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
   customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library
   is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
   You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution
   displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
   Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of
   this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if
      the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or
      source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to
      produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
      understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in
      the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to
      use the modified definitions.)

      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
      A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the
      library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
      copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
      properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs
      one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
      version that the work was made with.

      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a,
      above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
      distribution.

      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
      that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
   must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
   executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be
   distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
   and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
   component itself accompanies the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
   other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
   system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
   together in an executable that you distribute.

   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
   side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
   covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided
   that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the
   other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
   these two things:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
      the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
      of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
   is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.

   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
   it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
   Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
   Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
   distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
   licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
   the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so
   as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute
   the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
   royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
   it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
   Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
   or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
   this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
   software distribution system which is implemented by public license
   practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
   software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
   application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
   she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a
   licensee cannot impose that choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
   consequence of the rest of this License.

   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
   countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
   copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an
   explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
   that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
   In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
   body of this License.

   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
   either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
   Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version
   number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
   whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the
   author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free
   Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
   make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
   preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
   promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
   THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
   OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
   OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
   THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
   PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
   CORRECTION.

   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
   REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
   LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
   THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
   SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along
with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51
Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in

the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

by James Random Hacker.

That's all there is to it!

      each case including portions thereof.

      1.5. "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" means

         (a) that the initial Contributor has attached the notice described in
         Exhibit B to the Covered Software; or

      1.6. "Executable Form" means any form of the work other than Source Code
      Form.

      including without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims, in
      any patent Licensable by such Contributor that would be infringed, but

      sale, having made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its
      Contributor Version.

      1.12. "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
      Version 2.0, the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, the GNU

   2. License Grants and Conditions

      2.1. Grants

      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
      non-exclusive license:

         (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
         trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make
         available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit
         its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications,
         or as part of a Larger Work; and

         (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
         for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
         Contributions or its Contributor Version.

      2.2. Effective Date

      The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
      become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
      distributes such Contribution.

      2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

      The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
      this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
      distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
      Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
      Contributor:

         (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
         or

         (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
         modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
         Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
         Version); or

         (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence
         of its Contributions.

      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
      or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
      the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

      2.4. Subsequent Licenses

      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
      License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
      permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

      2.5. Representation

      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
      Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to
      grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

      2.6. Fair Use

      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
      applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
      equivalents.

      2.7. Conditions

      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
      Section 2.1.

   3. Responsibilities

      3.1. Distribution of Source Form

      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
      the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
      Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
      License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
      attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
      Form.

      3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
         Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
         the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
         Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than
         the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

         (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
         License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
         license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
         recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

      3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
      the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
      Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
      Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
      License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
      under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
      the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
      Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
      License(s).

      3.4. Notices

      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
      (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
      limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
      Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
      extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

      3.5. Application of Additional Terms

      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
      behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
      such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
      You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
      jurisdiction.

   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
   License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
   the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file
   included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License.
   Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
   must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
   to understand it.

   5. Termination

      5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
      compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
      Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
      Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
      ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
      non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
      come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
      Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
      notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
      first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
      from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
      Your receipt of the notice.

      5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
      counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
      You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
      2.1 of this License shall terminate.

      5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
      user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
      been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
      to termination shall survive termination.

   6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire
   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any
   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or
   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of
   this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
   License except under this disclaimer.

   7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
   not apply to You.

   8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of
   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business
   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
   prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

   9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to
   construe this License against a Contributor.

   10. Versions of the License

      10.1. New Versions

      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.

      10.2. Effect of New Versions

      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
      under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
      steward.

      10.3. Modified Versions

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
      version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
      references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
      modified license differs from this License).

      10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
      Licenses

      If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
      notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached. Exhibit A
      - Source Code Form License Notice

This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.
2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain
one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined by
the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.


B. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON
