    Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the
    entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation,
    rendering, compositing and motion tracking, and video editing.

    Blender is a public project, made by hundreds of people from around the
    world; by studios and individual artists, professionals and hobbyists,
    scientists, students, VFX experts, animators, game artists, modders, and
    the list goes on.
