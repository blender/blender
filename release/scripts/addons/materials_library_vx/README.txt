MATLIB 5.6.1

Installation:
- AVOID USING THE INSTALL ADDON BUTTON
- Copy the matlib folder inside Blender's addons.
Example: D:\Blender\2.72\scripts\addon\

- Start Blender.
- Goto File->User Preferences->Addons
- Enable "Material Library"


Updates:
v 0.5.61
- Libraries arent read on each draw call, only on startup or when added. This fixes potential crashes and is less stressful, but  when a library is deleted blender should be restarted.
-Moved the addon from "System" category to "Materials"

v 0.5.6
- Create new libraries.
	Libraries are read from the matlib folder. If you want to change this behaviour, edit the variable "matlib_path" at line 40. (Untested)
	
	To delete a library delete the blend file within the matlib folder.

- Apply material to all selected objects.

- Apply material in edit mesh mode.

- Improved Material preview.
	You can apply a material to the last selected object/s while you are previewing.

- Categories are saved within the library blend file.

- More warnings when things goes wrong.

- Options Added:
	- Force Import. False By default.
		This option helps to avoid material duplicates when the same material its applied several times.
		When this option is disabled the script will try to find the selected material within the working scene, instead of importing a new one from the library. 
	- Linked.
		Import the material by making a link to the library.
	- Hide search.
		Shows or hides the search box.
