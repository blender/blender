Average             average of element at selected level
Maximum             Maximum value of the list
Minimum             Minimum value of the list
=================== ======================================

Outputs

The output is always going to be a number, integer or float, depending on the input list.

* You can try to use this node with vectors, but it isn't going to work properly. For operations with vectors you should use **Vector Math** node.
