#  Purpose  : Uses the NatureUP1D predicate to select the lines
#             of a given type (among Nature.SILHOUETTE, Nature.CREASE, Nature.SUGGESTIVE_CONTOURS,
#             Nature.BORDERS).
#             The suggestive contours must have been enabled in the
#             options dialog to appear in the View Map.
