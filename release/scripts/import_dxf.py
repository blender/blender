This script imports objects from DXF (2d/3d) into Blender.

This script imports 2d and 3d geometery from DXFr12 format files.
Enhanced features are:
- configurable object filtering and geometry manipulation,
- configurable material pre-processing,
- DXF-data analyze and raporting.

Supported DXF r12 objects:
LINE,
POINT,
SOLID,
TRACE,
TEXT,
INSERT (=block),
MINSERT (=array of blocks),
CIRCLE,
ARC,
3DFACE,
2d-POLYLINE (=plane, incl. arc, variable-width, curve, spline),
3d-POLYLINE (=non-plane),
3d-POLYMESH,
3d-POLYFACE,
VIEW, VPORT
XREF (External Reference).

Supported DXF>r12 objects:
ELLIPSE,
(wip v1.0.12 partly supported) LWPOLYLINE (LightWeight),
(wip v1.0.12) MLINE,
(wip v1.0.12) MTEXT

Unsupported Objects:
DXF r12: DIMENSION.
DXF>r12: SPLINE, GROUP, RAY/XLINE, LEADER, 3DSOLID, BODY, REGION, dynamic BLOCK

Supported Geometry: 2d and 3d DXF-objects.
Curves imported as curves or meshes optionally.

Supported layout modes:
"model space" is default,
"paper space" as option (= "layout views")

Scene definitions produced with AVE_RENDER:
scene: selection of lights assigned to the camera,
lights: DIRECT, OVERHEAD, SH_SPOT,
(wip v1.0.13 import of AVE_RENDER material definitions)

Hierarchy:
Entire DXF BLOCK hierarchy is preserved after import into Blender
(BLOCKs as groups on layer19, INSERTs as dupliGroups on target layer).

Supported properties:
visibility status,
frozen status,
thickness,
width,
color,
layer,
(wip v1.0.12: XDATA, grouped status)
It is recommended to use DXF-object properties for assign Blender materials.

Notes:
- Recommend that you run 'RemoveDoubles' on each imported mesh after using this script
- Blocks are created on layer 19 then referenced at each insert point.
- Big DXF-files (over 1500 objects) decrease import performance.
The problem is not the inefficiency of python-scripting but Blenders performance
in creating new objects in his database - probably a database management problem.
	
TODO:  
- the new style object visibility
- support for real 3d-solids (ACIS)
- (to see more, search for "--todo--" in script code)
