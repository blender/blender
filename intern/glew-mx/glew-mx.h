/** \file glew-mx.h
 *  \ingroup glew-mx
 *
 * Support for GLEW Multiple rendering conteXts (MX)
 * Maintained as a Blender Library.
 *
 * Different rendering contexts may have different entry points
 * to extension functions of the same name.  So it can cause
 * problems if, for example, a second context uses a pointer to
 * say, glActiveTextureARB, that was queried from the first context.
 *
 * GLEW has basic support for multiple contexts by enabling WITH_GLEW_MX,
 * but it does not provide a full implementation.  This is because
 * there are too many questions about thread safety and memory
 * allocation that are up to the user of GLEW.
 *
 * This implementation is very basic and isn't thread safe.
 * For a single context the overhead should be
 * no more than using GLEW without WITH_GLEW_MX enabled.
