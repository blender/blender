/**
 * A 4x4 matrix. This is an OpenGl style matrix (column major) meaning
 * that the vector {m[0][0],m[0][1],m[0][2],m[0][3]} is the first column of
 * the matrix , the same as what you get if you transform {1,0,0,0}.
 * This makes it easy to transform stuff to OpenGl. Please note that the
 * the other MoTo matrices are row major.
 *
 * This class should be deprecated in favour of the more consistent
 * MT_Matrix4x4. Please do not start using this class.
