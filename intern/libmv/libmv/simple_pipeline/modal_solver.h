    This solver solves such camera motion as tripod rotation, reconstructing
    only camera motion itself. Bundles are not reconstructing properly, they're
    just getting projected onto sphere.

    Markers from tracks object would be used for recosntruction, and algorithm
    assumes thir's positions are undistorted already and they're in nnormalized
    space.

    Reconstructed cameras and projected bundles would be added to reconstruction
    object.
