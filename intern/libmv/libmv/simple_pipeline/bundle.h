    Refine camera poses and 3D coordinates using bundle adjustment.

    assumes a full observation for reconstructed tracks; this implies that if
    there is a reconstructed 3D point (a bundle) for a track, then all markers
    for that track will be included in the minimization. \a tracks should
    contain markers used in the initial reconstruction.

    The cameras and bundles (3D points) are refined in-place.

    \note This assumes an outlier-free set of markers.
    \note This assumes a calibrated reconstruction, e.g. the markers are
          already corrected for camera intrinsics and radial distortion.

    Refine camera poses and 3D coordinates using bundle adjustment.

    This routine adjusts all cameras positions, points, and the camera
    intrinsics (assumed common across all images) in \a *reconstruction. This

    there is a reconstructed 3D point (a bundle) for a track, then all markers

    The cameras, bundles, and intrinsics are refined in-place.

    Constraints denotes which blocks to keep constant during bundling.
    For example it is useful to keep camera translations constant
    when bundling tripod motions.

    If evaluaiton is not null, different evaluation statistics is filled in
    there, plus all the requested additional information (like jacobian) is
    also calculating there. Also see comments for BundleEvaluation.
