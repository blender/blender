/**
 * Drag & drop event
 * 
 * The dragging sequence is performed in four phases:
 * 
 * <li> Start sequence (GHOST_kEventDraggingEntered) that tells a drag'n'drop operation has started.
 * Already gives the object data type, and the entering mouse location
 *
 * <li> Update mouse position (GHOST_kEventDraggingUpdated) sent upon each mouse move until the drag'n'drop operation
 * stops, to give the updated mouse position. Useful to highlight a potential destination, and update the status
 * (through GHOST_setAcceptDragOperation) telling if the object can be dropped at
 * the current cursor position.
 *
 * <li> Abort drag'n'drop sequence (GHOST_kEventDraggingExited) sent when the user moved the mouse outside the window.
 *
 * <li> Send the dropped data (GHOST_kEventDraggingDropDone)
 *
 * <li> Outside of the normal sequence, dropped data can be sent (GHOST_kEventDraggingDropOnIcon).
 * This can happen when the user drops an object on the application icon.
 * (Also used in OSX to pass the filename of the document the user doubled-clicked in the finder)
 *
 * <br><br>Note that the mouse positions are given in Blender coordinates (y=0 at bottom)
 *
 * <br>Currently supported object types :
 * <li>UTF-8 string
 * <li>array of strings representing filenames (GHOST_TStringArray)
 * <li>bitmap ImBuf
