 * \page IK - Blender inverse kinematics module.
 *
 * \section about About the IK module
 *
 * This module allows you to create segments and form them into 
 * tree. You can then define a goal points that the end of a given 
 * segment should attempt to reach - an inverse kinematic problem.
 * This module will then modify the segments in the tree in order
 * to get the as near as possible to the goal. This solver uses an
 * inverse jacobian method to find a solution.
 * 
 * \section issues Known issues with this IK solver.
 *
 * - There is currently no support for joint constraints in the
 * solver. This is within the realms of possibility - please ask
 * if this functionality is required.
 * - The solver is slow, inverse jacobian methods in general give
 * 'smooth' solutions and the method is also very flexible, it 
 * does not rely on specific angle parameterization and can be 
 * extended to deal with different joint types and joint 
 * constraints. However it is not suitable for real time use. 
 * Other algorithms exist which are more suitable for real-time
 * applications, please ask if this functionality is required.     
 * 
 * \section dependencies Dependencies
 * 
 * This module only depends on Moto.

/**
 * Typical order of calls for solving an IK problem:
 *
 * - create number of IK_Segment's and set their parents and transforms
 * - create an IK_Solver
 * - set a number of goals for the IK_Solver to solve
 * - call IK_Solve
 * - free the IK_Solver
 * - get basis and translation changes from segments
 * - free all segments
 */

/**
 * IK_Segment defines a single segment of an IK tree. 
 * - Individual segments are always defined in local coordinates.
 * - The segment is assumed to be oriented in the local 
 *   y-direction.
 * - start is the start of the segment relative to the end 
 *   of the parent segment.
 * - rest_basis is a column major matrix defineding the rest
 *   position (w.r.t. which the limits are defined), must
 *   be a pure rotation
 * - basis is a column major matrix defining the current change
 *   from the rest basis, must be a pure rotation
 * - length is the length of the bone.  
 *
 * - basis_change and translation_change respectively define
 *   the change in rotation or translation. basis_change is a
 *   column major 3x3 matrix.
 *
 * The local transformation is then defined as:
 * start * rest_basis * basis * basis_change * translation_change * translate(0,length,0) 
 *
