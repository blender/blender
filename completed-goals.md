Completed Goals
===============

#1 - *Change Startup Screen Image - It should reflect the Blender Roots, but also showcase that the project is Independent. The Cover Image in the Github Page is recommended. My name can be removed from the image if required. Just make a request. When the project is mature, we can regularly update the Startup Image just like Blender.*  **COMPLETED - 5th July 2020**

#2 - *Removing and Adding Workspaces - First thing to remove is the Workspaces shown when opening a new File. We don't need Modeling, Sculpting, UV Editing, Texture Paint and Shading as Workspaces. Initially, remove just the Workspaces. And a Workspace Video Editing should be added. The recommended Workspace Hierarchy is: Video Editing, Color Grading, Rendering, Compositing, Masking, Motion Tracking, Scripting.* **COMPLETED - 5th July 2020**

#3 - *Modifying Startup File - Modifying Startup File to suit Video Editing and Audio Production workflows. This Goal is similar to the previous Goal of Removing and Adding Workspaces.* **COMPLETED - 5th July 2020**
